       "['uh so this feels a little strange to be talking into this, but um I’m feeling pretty uh that I will comply easily, so I will talk into this. Um when this study started – well, I guess when I was coming up um on whatever it is that I’m on um it was really uh sorta making me just loopy. Um I was getting waves of um like not really dizziness. I’m thinking of you know the physical symptoms on the sheet right now. Um it wasn’t really dizzy, though I said it was dizzy. And I think I said that it was a little bit of sleepiness too, um but it’s really – you just sorta – your head just sort of rushes in a way and um not really – it’s sort of like over stimulus like an over stimulated feeling, but in very short bursts. And so I was feeling just calm. I could feel myself breathe more. I was like more aware, more conscious of um my breaths and my mouth and just sort of uh sort of the surface level of um my face and body. Um and I was really just sort of feeling uh just out of it when the actual computer task started, um but every time that I was asked to do something, whether it was prompted on the screen or whether Selena asked me to do something I felt like I could do it just fine, even if it took me a little longer than it maybe would have uh had I been entirely sober to understand the directions at first, but then once I understood, I found it very easy uh to do everything. Um and even like helping out with uh and getting the speakers working um so that the computer would ding when the studies – when each part of the study was done. Um but really, uh about an – I don’t – maybe an hour into it, um I started coming out out of that like loopy phase. Um I no longer felt uh – I mean I guess I could say I still felt dizzy just because I’m disoriented, but uh still like given a task you know uh if I were to like you know balance on a beam or shoot a basketball or something like that, I still think I could do it well um or as well as I could any other time. But there’s just there’s this uh – I’ve – I recognize the feeling, uh that rush that I was talking about um and it’s very surface level. It’s very – it feels as if it’s right underneath the skin and uh that feeling – that feeling, that sort of synthetic rush uh like really pulled me out of that loopy phase and it it pulls me out sort of of whatever I’m doing, like when I’m talking right now. And I you know start uh breaking up as I am right now in the middle of a sentence and sorta falter. Uh it’s because I’m feeling uh this sort of rush, although like uh I think that I could continue to you know shoot a basketball or play a sport or something like that if maybe like a uh little less well than I could before. Uh I feel the same way now.',\n",
       " 'All right, so um I’m moderately bummed that Selena just left the room. Uh I enjoy talking with her. Uh I would really, I think, enjoy talking to anybody right now. Well, maybe anybody that’s, you know fairly pleasant to um very pleasant. Uh someone who’s really angry right now I probably wouldn’t connect with. I would you know feel his anger and want to help him. Uh it’s weird that I assumed it’s a him feeling angry, but him or her, whoever’s feeling angry. I would try to calm them down, but um anger’s just not really like uh not really something I can feel myself towards anything right now. Um well, I’m a little angry. Hmm not like angry as in like my body’s all tense and I’m mad, but really angry at the DEA and uh other law makers, um politicians that have made ecstasy illegal. If that is indeed what I’m on right now, then uh it really – it should be widely available to any consenting adult. It’s really, really nice. It’s a fun anti – it’s – the intoxication of it is fun like alcohol without the sloppiness; without the ego. I just uh uh sort of the uh you know – I’m upset right now that I have to just be talking and talking and talking. Um like I want to connect with somebody right now. I wanna have a conversation with somebody right now. I’d rather be uh conversing with anybody really than talking into this um uh I’ve read somewhere that MDMA is in pathogen, that it makes one feel empathetic. And uh I know Alexander Scoggin, the chemist who uh re-synthesized it and helped to popularize it in the ‘70s thought that ecstasy was a silly name and a misleading name and that it should be called empathy, um which I agree with more and more after he said that, but there’s still – ecstasy is still aptly named as well. Um I’d really, really like to be hanging out with other subjects in this study right now. If there were more subjects um doing this, then I would really want to talk to them right now and see how they’re feeling and get to know them. I’ve had uh a couple nights where I took what I believed to be ecstasy recreationally and had some of the best conversations of my life; made some friends that night that I feel could be lifelong friends. We’ll see. Uh there’s one girl in particular who uh I bonded with um completely platonically and just – it was just talk and we just had a nice conversation for just like three hours. it was awesome. And um and I’m gonna get to see her again soon. And those three hours of conversation were while we were rolling, which is the uh street term for being on ecstasy. Um and we just talked about our lives, our life, what we’re capable of doing and not doing. And uh it was just uh a really beautiful conversation and if that is the conversation that ecstasy has a hand in leading people towards, then it is by far a better drug than alcohol. It’s by far a better drug than other illegal drugs, and makes you way more lively and just up and honestly happy than marijuana does. Um I know marijuana’s not illegal, but it’s getting closer to being legal. Um it’s more socially acceptable to be a stoner than it is to uh take ecstasy a lot. Um I’ve read elsewhere that uh ecstasy loses its magic as Alexander Scoggin, the chemist who re-synthesized ecstasy in the ‘70s said. He said it loses its magic about ten times and I’m nearing that time now. And now I have to give this back to Selena.',\n",
       " 'Um all right, so not feeling out of the ordinary at all right now um so a little tired. I would have eaten by now in the day, something more than a little granola bar or uh had another cup of coffee. So um yeah, I’m just feeling sorta bored. Um not nearly as exciting as last time and uh I guess I thought it was sort of interesting uh doing the tasks uh sober, at least as what I think is sober. Um I had some of the same issues with them as I did before with uh the faces – the face recognition of uh you know some of the kids are pretty bad actors and uh you know when they make a angry face or a fearful face, a lot of the times, they’ll sorta smirk near the end of it or uh it’s comical to them, and that comes across in their face. It doesn’t look like an honest anger or an honest fear. Um so I guess it’s not as easy to do as making a happy face. Um I also just sort of had a thought that maybe happy faces are easier to recognize because it is a uh more advantageous for humans, at least nowadays when uh there’s little or you know less immediate danger than say when uh we were living in the wilderness. And it’s like better to just sort of like recognize and gravitate towards happiness. Um but yeah, the uh the picture task, the slideshow um uh what I was feeling the last – you know the other two times that I was uh doing this study, going through uh the slideshow it was um – you know, some of the pictures would effect me so much that I was uh still thinking about them when another picture was showing up, uh especially when it was more of a neutral picture. Um so uh yeah, I mean I guess that’s all part of it, but it seems like that’s uh a little – you know it’s a little weird. I’d much rather uh – well, I think it would be interesting to see what people said if uh – you know if you did the slideshow, but allowed them to talk uh as long as they wanted to about a certain picture or try to like be affected as much as possible by a picture or you know just sort of exhaust their um feelings and thoughts about a picture before moving on. Um I think you’d get some pretty interesting responses; maybe not uh on the placebo unless it’s a really interesting person, a really interesting subject. But um yeah, especially on the drug – the drug subjects would be better at uh or be more interesting, at least out of the ordinary when talking about the pictures. Uh yeah, like I said, I could use some coffee right now. Hoping Selena will come back soon. Uh this is increasingly awkward to be talking into this. It’s a nice voice recorder though. I had one sort of like it, but um lost – it was one of the ones that you could unplug. You like take out the battery and you can – it’s a USB port and you can plug it in – or not a port, a USB connector. You can plug it into a port on your computer, but I lost the piece with the battery in it. So it’s forever uncharged now. And here’s five minutes. Selena should be coming through soon. And here we go.',\n",
       " 'This is by far one of the strangest highs I’ve ever had. Um it feels like uh like after a peak kind of like the downfall. It’s starting to wear off now, but I felt it while I was taking those freaking face things, and those things, oh my God, they’re so weird. Um I feel like like after after you like after you’ve peaked and then it’s kind of like a come down, but that was that was like the peak of the drug that I took right now. It was like the come down of of uh of of of ganja, marijuana. Uh I just wanna go to sleep. It’s hard. I didn’t get enough sleep last night. Yeah, weird stuff, definitely – definitely not MDMA. Uh I’m thinking some sort of cannabis-like replacement, but it’s strange. It’s really weird. It was kind of annoying too. It was like – I kind of wanted it to go away. It was almost – it was almost like a headache. It was like uh it was like it was like uh it was like a super head rush, but I was like so – it was like too intense that it was so unenjoyable, I guess. I don’t know; very bizarre. Olympus made in China. That’s a direct connection. 1.5 volt, triple A batteries. It has a USB.',\n",
       " 'I need to go. I need to run. I need to run. I need to run now. I need to go run, run, swim, jump, something; do something. Um I need to do something, uh tap my foot or something. I don’t know; something. I can’t sit here very longer. Ah, there we go. That’s better. Tapping the foot helps. Tapping the foot definitely helps. Yes, tapping the foot definitely helps, definitely helps. Tapping foot, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap foot because –stop record, play, stop record. Oh man, I need to do something. I should do something. I can’t just sit here. I can’t just sit here. I can’t do it. It won’t work. I can’t just sit here. I have to run, jump and swim, dance. Yeah, dance, that would work. Dancing would work, yeah. That would work. Yeah, dancing would work. Dancing would uh definitely work. Uh, I need to do something. I can’t let – I can’t sit here anymore watching that thingy, so strange. I need to go. No. I need to go back to sleep today. I don’t wanna go to sleep anymore. I wanna go run, run far or skateboard, yeah skateboard. I can’t sit here any longer. It’s not gonna work. I need to go do something.',\n",
       " 'I just want to go to sleep. Oh, I do wonder what the EN6200PC – I’m guessing it’s omnidirectional. But we could go find that right now, couldn’t we? Hey. Olympus, VN200. Here we are. And if we go to this, call up, we could find everything about this thing. Uh-huh. Oh, it’s an archive product. We can’t find anything about it unless we go to Amazon maybe. Oh. Interesting. However, it doesn’t tell me any of the specs. Hmm. Ah, here’s the technical details. Okay. Oh. Mm, we’ve got SPNLP. Four-hundred forty-four hours. That’s a lot. ESP. However it fails to tell me anything important about it, like if it’s an omnidirectional microphone. Strange. Oh well. I just want to go to sleep. It is a neat little device though. It has a line in. However it’s pretty useless for me. Because that line in is definitely a mini one. And I would need converter, an transformer. Bizarre. I can’t think right now, so I can’t really tell you what. Okay? Mm. Very interesting. Well, it’s been five minutes.',\n",
       " 'Well, getting here today, um, I ran into a lot of traffic. Um, my brother dropped me off and, uh, we were coming from the north suburbs, um, up in Libertyville. And there was quite a bit of traffic, um, coming up from there on 94 and it took a little bit longer than I thought it was gonna take. We left about 7:00 o’clock and didn’t end up getting here until about 10:00. So it was almost three hours pretty much in the car. Um, right now I’m unemployed and looking for a job, um, had an interview yesterday with LA Fitness and wasn’t what I expected. Um, I have a personal training certificate, spent money on that, so was looking to do that and it was more of a sales position, so I don’t think I’m gonna accept that position. And, um, have another interview today and then I have another one on Friday, so hoping to land a job pretty soon, um, I’ve been unemployed since May. And, um, I went to school for music and have been doing property management for the last eight years and decided I’m in a point in my life where I don’t want to do that, so looking for something in the personal training field or possibly, um, teaching music. So kind of applying for a lot of different jobs right now, but I think we’re all pretty much in the state in the economy where we just, you know, need a job, so I’m be happy with a good job. I just think this, uh, one from yesterday wouldn’t be a good fit, so hopefully something’ll come up this week. So if, um, nothing comes from these interviews this week, then I’ll probably apply for more jobs this weekend and try to get some more phone calls for next week and keep optimistic about that. So my plans for this weekend should be fun. Um, I’m gonna be going with some friends to a club on Friday and, uh, we won free entry and bottle service which is kind of fun, um, to one of the clubs in Chicago, one of my favorite clubs. It’s kind of on the northwest side, so that should be fun. I’m inviting a bunch of friends and they’re gonna be bringing some people. So I’m gonna do that on Friday and, um, my parents are out of town. They went down to Florida to our house down there, so they’re not gonna be home. It’ll probably be just me and my brother and I’m not sure what I’m doing on Saturday and Sunday. I don’t have plans quite yet, but hopefully something fun. Maybe hang out with some friends, take it easy. Nothing major. Look for jobs. Probably workout. So that’s what I got planned for this weekend, for Labor Day weekend and, um, a lot of people are gonna be off Monday, but since I’m not working, it doesn’t really excite me any. So that’s pretty much all I’ve got planned as of right now. So hopefully I’ll be landing a job shortly, the next week or so, but I’ve been unemployed for longer than a couple of months, actually. I’ve been unemployed for seven months at one point, but I’m keeping my chin up and remaining optimistic that I’ll find something, so that I can have money to catch up on my bills and be able to go out and have a life again. Have my own place so I don’t have to live at home. That would be very nice. Anyway, running out of stuff to think about. Hum, I guess this weekend, um, at home, I’ll spend some time with the dogs ‘cause I have a dog, a little beagle, he’s about 25 pounds and my parents have a Havanese.',\n",
       " 'What I did this weekend, um, actually it was a pretty good weekend. Um, I went to see one of my favorite DJs at, um, a club called The Mid, downtown Chicago. Um, his name is Marcus Schultz, and he DJs, um, kind of transprogressive, um, techno-type music. Um, so it was a lot of fun. Um, got there at about 10:00, and it was a long concert. Well, he didn’t come on until about like 1:00, and, uh, lasted until about 4:30 AM, so it was a long night, but, um, one of my favorite DJs, so I was really excited about that. So it was kind of a good weekend. And then I had brunch on Sunday with, um, a couple of my good friends, Nathan and Evie, and we went to a dim sum restaurant for brunch in Evanston, which was a lot of fun. And, um, got to catch up with them. They’re actually going back home to Indonesia in November, which, um, another one of my friends, Olin, lives in Indonesia, so they’re going to get to see her. And, uh, we were talking about that, and some friends from there that, I guess, are doing really well, so that was kind of nice. Um, right now, I’m involved in a couple shows and I’m starting a new job, uh, next Monday, so I’m a little bit nervous about that. Um, my training is going to be on the south suburbs, actually, for export. I’m going to be a personal trainer. The only reason I’m nervous is just that I don’t know how much money I’m going to be making upfront. Um, a lot of it is commission, um, and trying to get clients and making money that way, so that’s why I’m a little bit nervous. It’s not, um, like a salary that I know I’m going to be getting every single, uh, couple weeks, which I’ve been used to for like the last eight years, so should be interesting. Um, don’t really have any plans this weekend other than I’ve got rehearsals for two shows that I’m in. Um, I’m doing Rent with Harper College, and, um, I’m in the ensemble there, and then I have a role in the show called The Merry Widow. So I have rehearsal Saturday, and, um, I also have rehearsal Sunday. Um, I’m not sure if I’m going to be doing anything else this weekend, um, with rehearsals going on. I might see a couple friends, but other than that, I don’t have anything really exciting planned. Um, I’ve got a concert coming up in October that I’m going to go to, that I’m excited about, and, um, I want to go to Fright Fest this year for Halloween. It should be fun. Um, up at Great America. Um, I like roller coasters, and all that fun stuff, and all the costumes and decorations, and all that. It should be fun, so. Um, don’t know what else to talk about. Um, hopefully I’ll be moving out of my parent’s house because right now, I live up north in the suburbs, so I’m kind of looking for a place in the city, which will be nice to get back out on my own. I mean I’ve only been at home for like a month, so it’s not a huge deal, but it’ll be nice to, uh, get an apartment again and kind of be out on my own. So probably do that this week and start looking for a place. Um, it’ll be nice instead of living at home with my parents. My brother lives there, too, and he works part-time, and I know he wants to move out, but he’s waiting to get a full-time job before he moves out, and I start mine, so once I start making some money, I’ll be able to move out, which will be cool. And that’s it. My job is in the city, um, near Belmont and Ashland, so it’ll be better to live in the city and not have to commute as far from the North Bridge, which takes forever, especially in traffic. And there’s just no easy way to get with the train. It’s pretty much the same amount of time, so it’ll be much more convenient to live in the city and work in the city, and kind of do everything in the city because just the traffic. That’s it.',\n",
       " 'Well, my name is Brian. Um, I just started a new job this week. Um, I am a personal trainer at Export Fitness here in Chicago. Um, we’ve had our training this past week in Chicago Ridge, south suburbs, and, um, I started on Monday. So far, it’s been a really good experience. Um, I used to do property management for a long time, and, uh, decided that I didn’t want to do that, so I ended up getting a personal training certificate in June down in Florida, where I was living. And, um, decided this was something that I wanted to try and do, so, um, I got hired and we’re doing training, um, right now. It’s a 70-training program, so it’s pretty intense. Um, the first couple days, just, you know, learning about the company and basic paperwork, but, um, we’re training clients and getting some good experience, so it’s been fun. I’m kind of excited about it. Um, yeah, so it’s been kind of a busy week because I live up in the north ‘burbs, and then I’m driving all the way down to Chicago Ridge for training, and it’s about an hour drive without traffic, so. Um, and then I’m going to be working at a club in Lakeview, and that’s going to be my club and will start there on Wednesday. Um, in addition to all this, I’m doing two shows. Um, I went to school for vocal performance, so I’m a singer and actor. Um, I’m doing the show Rent – it’s a musical – with Harper College, and our rehearsals have been, um, about three or four times a week. So I had rehearsal yesterday, um, for that show from like 10 to 2, and then I also have another show, which I’m doing. It’s called The Merry Widow. It’s a German opera, and I have a role in that show and have to get, um, the role memorized by next Saturday. Um, rehearsals for that have been once a week, and started last week, so I had that going on yesterday, too, from 3 to 6, so my day was quite busy. And then, of course, I was at work all week, um, and I’m here today and then I’ll be back to work again tomorrow, and Tuesday will be the last days of training. And then I’ll be starting at my club on Wednesday, and then I’ll have to see what my schedule is going to be like from there, but, um, musical rehearsals are going to be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, um, so, as you can imagine, my schedule has been pretty full, um, which is good. Which is good. I mean I lost my job in Tampa back in May. I had been looking for work and trying to figure out what I was going to do, and I wasn’t doing anything, so now, I’m busy. Got pretty much of a overwhelming schedule, so keeping busy with that, and, um, I haven’t seen my friends in a couple of weeks because I’ve been so crazy busy, so hopefully, um, we’ll get together, you know, maybe this coming weekend, um, maybe a couple nights after work or something if I can, uh, get the energy to do something, so, just because it’s been kind of nuts. Um, I’ve got a couple of concerts that I’m looking forward to, uh, one on the 15th and then one at the end of the month, so I’m kind of excited about those. And Halloween’s coming, so that’ll be fun. I definitely want to plan something. I kinda want to go to Fright Fest, but I don’t know if that’s going to happen, um, just time-wise, and then, of course, money-wise, um, but I’m sure like my friends and I will do something fun for Halloween. I’ve got a costume already, so, um, I’m going to be a gladiator, so that should be cool. And, um, that’s pretty much what my plans are as of right now. So, um, the show starts November 8th for Rent, goes to the 20th, and then The Merry Widow, um, we’re doing a concert towards end of October, and then a performance in November. So I’ll be keeping pretty busy through November, especially with the new job, so I can’t wait until all that is over.',\n",
       " 'Okay, I’m awake. Hi. Um, what am I talking about? Well, I guess they give me some kind of drug, and I’m feeling different than how I usually do, so I’ll make pronouncements on that. Um, I’ll move it closer to me here. I mean aside from the drugs and everything, I am usually sort of tense person. People – not – I’m very sociable. I have a lot of friends and stuff, but, um, other than that, I’m pretty tense. Uh, I’m angry. My close friends know that about me. I can like hide it, you know, ha-ha-ha at a bar or at a party or classmates and stuff, but I am. And, uh, you know, it’s really hard. I, um, I don’t know. So I’m like that, and, uh, it really gets in the way of – you know, I have a decent life, but it gets in the way of a lot of things. I’m always, you know, sort of on edge, even with like people I really know very well, even some of them. I’m often on edge for like people saying snotty stuff, and, um, people do and I really don’t like that. They always – you know, they – whatever. You know, someone who reads the same article in the newspaper as you do and they have to pronounce to the whole class how smart they are because they read it or something. Like I read the same article in the Tribune, too, or whatever. That stuff gets me down. I don’t know. People think, you know, try to be so smart or they try to be so clever, you know, which I kind of do, too, but it really annoys me. Um, yeah. Always in my head I run through things a lot, like should I – if I see so and so, or should I see so and so, if I talk about this topic, what should I say? Um, I don’t know. Why? Just so I can not be proved wrong? Just so I can look smart? Who cares? But I do that, you know. I really, I don’t know, losing those arguments. Losing arguments. I don’t usually. I’m pretty good. But, uh, who cares. Just let people say something. But that’s the thing, like people say things if they – you know, any topic besides how’s the weather, they say things, you know? I don’t know. Stupid a lot of times. Blah, blah, blah. I love everyone right now. Um, I can’t really think of any good examples. That’s like – okay, here’s one. My father, he loves to watch the news and, uh, you know, when the news people, either it’s, you know, the reporter live in front of the building where something happened, or if they’re interviewing someone who just saw something happen, you know, and those people use, you know, they use incorrect English or if they, you know, they’re subject, their noun-verb agreement is off or something like that, he loves pointing that out and saying, “Oh, what the hell? Stupid. You know, don’t they know whatever?” And, uh, it’s like come on. Give it – you know, someone sticks a microphone at your face, you’re on live TV and you’ve got 10 things, you know, you’re going to say, “I’m at the building, which is the,” like you’re going to like repeat yourself some or, you know, it’s like God, give it a rest, dude, but he just does that. I don’t like it, but I’ve kind of become – I’m sort of like that myself, but I don’t know. It’s, you know, it’s fun to always say – have smart things to say. It’s funny. People laugh, and I like laughing, too. All right. Done.',\n",
       " 'Hey, person, uh, transcribing this. Hope you’re having a good day at work. Um, so what did I do last night? I saw someone I barely even know. A, uh, friend of mine from high school’s brother I hung out with. Yeah, he’s a nice enough guy. I can tell he’s, uh, he’s lonely and he lives in Chicago, like me and, uh, lives way on at like, he’s like 30 and he doesn’t even, like, he doesn’t live in a young person part of town, he lives in, uh, way out by the airport. I don’t know, cheap, I guess it’s inexpensive, safe. He works all day on the computer doing computer stuff at home, so pretty kind of – kind of lonely. And, uh, not much of a talker either, I got to say. Uh, I’d try to bring things up, like a conversation and he gets all logical on me. I’m just like, you know, saying something ‘cause nothing else, you know, ‘cause besides talking about sports, what can we talk about? Um, but he, uh, you know, I tried to bring some funny thing up and he kind of like be all logical, that doesn’t make any sense. fine. conversation. But, uh, like his brother sort of hangs on. He doesn’t, like, want to go home. He doesn’t want to, um, so I try to be nice and hang out with him, but I don’t know. Unless it’s watching a sports game, I don’t know how much I could hang out with him. Maybe at a party, bunch of people, but, yeah. And it didn’t help that I had to drink water because I had to do this test today, but I don’t think so. I didn’t drink any beer, I promise. Um, that would’ve helped also. What else? Um, yeah, I got, uh, terms in my life I got to get better at, it sounds bad, but getting what I want out of people, I’m so bad at that. I, uh, you know, I’m charming, but people like me, but I can’t, like, you know, I don’t pick my battles with people or I try to but I never have been able to have people do me favors. I don’t know. I’m like a pushover, all right. I do them a favor and then they – they – they say, “No,” to me. At – at work situations, home situations, you know, few people. But I mean, my god, I remember my parents would drive my brother all around the city, drop him at friend’s houses when he was a teenager and they never did that for me. They, I don’t know, it’s like this is one example, it just, just – I don’t know. I – I just say, can you please do this? And I, like, talk to people up and they say, “No.” Something I got to work on, I guess. Um, smoozing, talking right, getting what I – I want out of people. I remember my program in school a teacher, my professor told me to do something and I said, “That’d take a lot of time. That’s a lot of work.” She said, “Never say that.” And then a week later, because you know, we’re supposed to do our best work, doesn’t matter if it takes forever, you know, we’re supposed to do our best. And then a week or two later, she says to someone else, “This work’s unacceptable,” this guy, “This work is unacceptable, you have to do it over. I mean, it’s good, but it’s not what you can do, it’s not the b” – you know. And he told her, “No, I’m not gonna do that. It’s gonna take me eight hours to redo this. I refuse to do that.” And she let him you know? That really, I mean, all sorts of stuff like that, like, how come I can’t do that? How come I just, “Okay, whatever you say.”. I don’t know, I try to be agreeable I guess. I don’t know kind of to bite me in the butt. I just try to show that I’m worthy through actions or show that I’m worthy through – okay. Bye. What?',\n",
       " 'Hi, there. Um, hope you’re having a good day, whoever’s, uh, to the dear person who’s writing this down and the people who are, uh, reading it. Um, hi, there. So what’s up with me? Well, I – a helicopter was, uh, woke me up this morning at 6:00, which is on the early side for me and it st – it was like right over my house, for like 15 minutes and that was pretty annoying. Then, you know, I looked out the window of my bedroom and it wasn’t there and I looked out the, uh, window of another room and it wasn’t there ‘cause it was right over my house, well, off by like half a block, I think. You could almost see it – you could see it, you know, if I just stuck my head out the window. Yeah, it was there for 20 minutes. It was a news helicopter and they’re getting a shot of, uh, uh, the city and of, uh, an expressway, I guess and it was foggy so they had to be low today or something. That really upset me. Well, it didn’t really upset me, but, um, that’s a peeve. And I was up early and I got to doing some stuff and I, uh, I decided I’d clean my have some time before I come in to do this. So I was up and I cleaned my bathroom and I was kind of reading a book and I realized it was almost 8:30, I should get going and I’ll be late to this thing. And, uh, I have to shave before I come here because they put electrodes on my face and so I – that’s part of the reason I was late, ‘cause I had to shave. I can’t just leave right away, so I shaved and I cut myself on my neck and on the way here, I bled, I was bleeding and I have some blood on the inside of my collar, which I didn’t realize until just now. And then I’m sure the young lady saw when, uh, she was putting electrodes on my face monitoring, uh, face – facial movement that, um, I blo – I have blood all over my shirt, that’s kind of embarrassing, isn’t it? All right. That’s what’s on my mind. Um, oh, but a nice thing happened this morning. I was on my way here and I got off the bus and it just started pouring, like, the minute I got off the bus, it was raining, but then it just – and the clouds opened up and it really started pouring. And I was kind of waiting to cross the street and a nice old lady had an umbrella and I didn’t and she told me to walk under – you know, come to her, well, stand next to while she, uh, held the umbrella for the both of us while we were wai – waited for the light to change. And that was, uh, such a sweet thing to have happen, isn’t it? So that’s nice. That’s happened – that’s my day so far. I’m gonna sign off now because, uh, I got really nothing to say, except I’m really hungry, so if I fill out dizzy on these forms it’s because I’m hungry, it’s not because I’m, uh, I’m feeling the drug affect. All right. Signing off, bye.',\n",
       " 'Um, well, this has been an interesting experience. If I had to guess what the substance that I’m on is, I would probably say it’s ecstasy. This is something I’ve done for back when I was in undergrad a couple of times. A lot of the sensations that I am experiencing are very similar to that. So again, very interesting – definitely bizarre doing a club drug like that while I’m doing a task on the computer as composed, or as compared to what I had experienced in the past, which would be dancing around in a dark room with glow sticks swinging. Um, don’t really have much planned for today. I have paperwork I need to do for my work; that’s uh, continuously piling up. And well, not necessarily behind because I’m doing more than what the job requires, but still, it never goes away and we’re getting ready for audits, so I need to do above and beyond what I normally do to make sure everything’s ready for our agency to pass inspection. My wife is hanging out with one of her friends who lives up close to Rodger’s Park. I’m anxious to see whether or not she’ll be here on time. We, um, this is her first time driving to Hyde Park from where we live, so I hope that she is able to make it and not get lost, not running into any problems. I was supposed to go watch football with some friends last night; I did not do that because I did not feel well. I think I got ahold of some bad Chinese food, so beware of Panda Express. Um, warm weather is very odd that we’re having. I mean, I guess it’s odd; I don’t really know, I’m not well-versed in climate. You know, people talk about climate change. However, by what I have read and what I’ve heard, there’s a lot of competing empirical data on that subject. So I’ve heard the jury’s still out on that one. There’s a of isopropyl rubbing alcohol 70 percent directly in front of me; it’s from CVS. Brown box. Um, it’s an old CRT TV over there. I bet that thing is heavy. I had a good holiday – I got to go back to my hometown and visit a lot of people – a lot of family, a lot of friends I haven’t seen in quite some time, which was nice. Well, I guess nice and depressing at the same time. I’ve got some friends that aren’t really living up to their potential and have some issues of their own that are keeping them from, I think, really enjoying their life. But there’s always hope. Uh, watched some good movies lately. I found out that one of my coworkers is a huge Martin Scorsese fan, which is nice, because I, too, enjoy his work. And it’s nice to have someone at work that you can talk to about things other than work sometimes because it’s good to be able to just give your mind a break and discuss lighthearted subject matter. Some good movies – I’ve been looking for the movie Dark City. My wife and I, we both like kind of dark,, sci-fi type movies. And she’s never seen Dark City. And that’s not the old Dark City, but it’s a movie that came out I think in the 90’s. It’s a great sci-fi flick. The reason I mentioned it to her is we recently watched the movie Inception, and it reminded me of Dark City to a degree in terms of like conspiracy about people working behind the scenes.',\n",
       " 'Uh, this week has been an eventful week to some degree. I had an alright work week. I had some, I guess, some conflict with my – one of my supervisors, but I think she’s – her uh, time at my agency is drawing to or coming to an end because apparently she’s been having problems with a lot of people. Um, but I was able to get a lot of my stuff done, which is nice. I went out with some of my coworkers on Friday after work, which was cool because I guess the program that I work for historically has not really had a lot of camaraderie amongst staff. But the people that I work with now are all good people, and we seem to enjoy working with each other, respect each other. So we went to this weird Hawaiian themed bar that is in River Grove – I think that’s what the name of the suburb slash village was. It’s a Hawaiian themed bar, and all of their drinks are weird fruity – like uh, tropical-type beach drinks. I don’t even know what those things are called, like frozen drinks basically. They had a huge menu that had like 70-80 different types of these fruity drinks, so that was fun. I had an interesting conversation with the bartender when I – because I was the first one to get there, so I was waiting for my colleagues to show up. Uh, he explained to me how he was an astrological psychologist, non-degree holding, and talked about how he counsels people based off of their astrological sign. Um, so I stayed out of starting any conflict or arguing any points with him because I, too, am a counselor, but from the psychological, not the astrological, sense. Just kind of fun listening to him talk to some of the other bar patrons about things that he thought he knew. He discussed ECT and lobotomies and got a lot of his facts wrong, but whatever. I entertained them, didn’t challenge. I was there for a good time, didn’t really wanna get into a, uh, debate of, you know, accuracies in terms of his facts that he was providing. Uh, went to Uncle Fattie’s Friday night with a group of friends. Uh, my one friend who’s brother’s the drummer for Mike and Joe, and I’ve kinda become friends with them. So we went to watch them play and support them, and that was a pretty interesting night. I’m pretty sure I got taken advantage of by a cab driver because on the way home, I remember at one point being on Lake Shore Drive and thinking to myself, there’s no need to be on Lake Shore Drive to get to my apartment from here. So I think the guy went a roundabout way, and probably charged me more than I, uh, really needed to be charged, but I guess that’s what happens when you get too drunk in public. So uh, I broke the light in my pantry at my apartment. I went to pull the cord and tripped over a box and fell while having to hold the cord, so I ripped the cord out of the light itself. So I’ve got to go to, I think there’s a close to my apartment, so I need to go there today to purchase a new one and replace it so Karl doesn’t get mad at me for breaking his stuff. Karl’s my landlord. Used to be my wife’s boss – when she was in Grad school, she was working at a bar called The Rail. The owner is Karl, so through that we kind of became friends. And then when he found out we were wanting to move to Roscoe Village, he had an apartment. So we took him up on the offer. It was nice because he threw in a garage spot for free, which allows me to keep my motorcycle here in the city, so that’s great.',\n",
       " 'Okay, um, I once knew a guy named Bob. Now, I guess the reason I’m sharing this story with this wonderful recording device is that I knew the guy a long time and I haven’t actually seen him in a long time. Over the years, our relationship kind of – well, we grew apart. Um, when I was growing up in the town that I’m from, Bob actually lived down the street from me a little bit. I first met him in kindergarten. He lived, I guess, down the street from me his whole life too, since he was born, but oddly enough, I actually never came in contact with him until I started school. Um, and Bob was cool. It was one of those types of things – I mean, even though I struggle to remember all the details now, I do remember that we kind of hit it off instantly. He actually initiated the first interaction that we had. I remember walking into the classroom on the very first day, sitting down at a desk, and this kid just walking over to me and being like, “Hey, what’s up? I’m Bob. Who are you?” type of thing. And our relationship just grew from there. Um, and into a good one. I used to get off the bus when I got home from school at his house, and we would hang out together until I knew my parents would be arriving home, and then I would just walk down the street to where they were and, you know, have dinner and deal with whatever else. Um, I remember playing all kinds of games – cowboy and Indians… I used to sit – I had a lot of toys that we would play with, a lot of action figurines. I remember pretending to blow up the, uh, little GI Joe soldiers and things with him. He also had a – behind his house there was like this, uh, I don’t know, there’s like a drainage tunnel – I guess that’s what you would, uh, consider it – that went underneath a highway that ran beyond – along the back of his property. And we used to play in that, uh, tunnel, pretend like it was a cave, and spend hours inside of that thing creating fantastic stories that we were either stranded survivors or in war, hiding there for cover from artillery fire. Um, eventually, as we got older, we took it upon ourselves to build a, uh, little, uh, almost like a tree house – a little fort thing that we used, uh, shipping palettes and random pieces of wood and plywood that we could find on our parents’ property and in our garage, and we were able to kind of continue our adventures, if you would, through the use of that shed. Um, eventually, as we got older, we got into, I guess they’re called power sports. We both had four wheelers or ATV’s, whatever you wanna call them. Um, we spent a lot of time together in the summer building trails through the woods that ran along my property, and we would ride – ride for hours at a time. I can’t even imagine the amount of gasoline we ran through those ATV’s and the amount of – and the years that we rode them. Um, but eventually, I think we started to kind of drift apart really in high school. I, uh, I became more of a, uh, science-y guy; I became very interested in education around high school, and he became a, uh, very conservative Christian type, began going to summer church camp, spending a lot of time at his church, whereas I began spending a lot more time in extracurricular activities, and involved with school, whether it was science club or, um, other extracurricular, like, uh, choir or drama or data club. Um, and I think just because of those different preferences that we kind of evolved. We began to spend less and less time with each other, and more time with a new group of friends. And I guess as that continued, we just began to find that we had less and less in common. And then when I went to college and he actually went to a Bible college, eventually the contact we had became pretty much nonexistent, and that’s really how it is to this day. I think about a year ago – and I just made all that up! Awesome!',\n",
       " \"All right, I'm not quite sure what to talk about. I guess what's going on right now in my life – like I said – I'm in transition. Me – I've talked to Selena about it a few times. In transition – I left my previous job because it was just frustrating. It was a really poor environment to work in. I worked in the mall. That's part of it. I'm definitely not a mall kinda person. I'm a little bit anti-consumerism, which is ironic because I worked in retail sales in a very high-pressure environment where we were selling a lot of clothes, especially around the holiday season. So, I'm glad I had the courage or boldness – or maybe even foolishness – to leave that situation willingly and kinda try to search for something that is more along the lines of my personality and, you know, like it's more of a natural fit, as opposed to something that I did just for money or convenience. I think I'm really looking for something that's gonna be fulfilling, something that I'm gonna be passionate about, I'm gonna love, and something that I'm gonna wanna – I'm gonna smile, you know, the majority of days that I'm going there in the mornings. So, I'm in transition. I had an interview with Enterprise. I think that that went relatively well. The conversation flowed. I think I was confident. I was upbeat. I practiced my answers a ton before the interview. I was dressed nice, clean-cut, and just the general feel that I got from the interviewer, she seemed to be pretty into me – smiled, had some jokes, made small talk. It felt pretty conversational the majority of the time. My second interview was with another retail sales shop, but a lot different than the environment I was in before. It's more so my – like I said, it's something I'm interested in. It's like sports – sportswear, college sports – college and professional sport teams, and it's in Chicago, which is probably Priority No. 1 – that the job I find is in the city so I can finally make that transition from the suburbs to living somewhere in Chicago. The interview was pretty well. Not sure – I'm sorry. I lost my train of thought. I got a pretty positive impression from that, too. I think that one might have went a little bit smoother than the Enterprise interview. I think the interviewer was a little bit less intimidating and it just felt more – it just felt more – I just felt more at ease talking to Dan as I – opposed to when I interviewed with Wanda over at Enterprise. So, hopefully, I'll hear back today or tomorrow – Thursday – some time before the end of the week. My plans after I leave – after I leave this office, I'm not sure. I'm gonna have some time to kill. I might try to hook up with one of my friends out here while I'm here. It's always convenient to just kinda kill two birds with one stone and reconnect with some of the friends I have out here. Hmm, what else? What else? I have this habit of bookmarking – bookmarking jobs that I plan to apply for – a lot of them on Craigslist, some of them on Idealist.org – but I have about a half a dozen that I still need to get to, probably today while I have all this time. I think part of the reason why I procrastinate that is the anxiety. I can't take the rejection any more. It's really frustrating. It's really frustrating to feel like you should be getting responses or at least getting screening interviews on – regularly – and not hearing back when I feel like I'm applying to jobs that I may even be overqualified for. So, I'll see. I'll read some more articles. Talk to some more people. Get some more advice and maybe I can figure out, you know, ways to improve my cover letter, especially. I think my résumé is pretty solid, but my cover letter, I think, is pretty generic. So, wish me luck with that.\",\n",
       " \"All right, I'm not sure what quite to talk about. I guess I can talk about what I feel like is happening here. The checkpoints are definitely to make sure that I am safe to leave. I think that Selena might have been throwing in some things that differentiate it from the patterns that she did in the previous two sessions because – to make sure that I'm level-headed, and I'm safe to be around, safe to go out into the world on my own because it's a huge liability for them to be giving me drugs, and then, you know, like testing me. I consented to it and I'm completely okay with it, but I do understand that there are risks involved and I think that the University of Chicago does a great job of – you know, they do a great job of making sure that I'm comfortable, safe, making sure that Selena is comfortable and safe. It's a pretty crowded office. I mean – what else? What else? Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo – I am still comfortable with what I'm doing. There's no worry about that. I definitely am in a position to do it and it's not an issue for me to be, you know, a subject here whatsoever. It actually gives me something to do because I am really, really over applying to millions of jobs a day, sending out my application dozens of times to jobs that I don't want, but I need. But I'm really looking forward to the interview tomorrow. Still have some – a little bit of preparation, but I'm looking forward to really showing – to really having an interview with a job that I'm gonna be super-passionate about, something I have experience with, something that is near and dear to me. I love youth work and just, you know, creating smiles, kinda being that role model and child advocate that I think a lot of youth programs look for. And they're – and they're, like, you know, program coordinators, managers, you know, direct youth workers – whatever it is. Yeah, I hope that – I really hope it goes well because that would be a great start to the career that I hope to – you know, I hope to – I hope to continue to do, like, you know, long-term, eventually working my way up the ladder to something administrative, potentially in a directoral role, some years from now. What else? What else? Choo, choo, choo, choo – hmm, definitely feel myself coming down, not too hard, but definitely, you know, there was a peak. And now, it's, you know, the gradual come-down. I'm still – I don't know. I would say I'm about a five. I'm at a five – ten being high, zero being when I walked into the door. Yeah, about a five, four, three. I don't know. It's going down, so hard to say. Hmm, what else? What else? My fantasy basketball team is doing really well. I won my last three matches. I'm currently in third place in the division – in the – yeah, in the division. Third out of, like, twelve – doing pretty good. Little irritated Derek Rose is not – is injured. He's got back spasms, pretty severe back spasms because he's a tough dude from Chicago, and he is – it's painful to walk for him. So, I really hope he gets better, not just for my fantasy team, but for his own well-being. I think he's a rare athlete – all right.\",\n",
       " 'Let’s take this time to practice my 80-second elevator speech. Who is Reggie professionally? Not exactly who I am professionally but what I want someone evaluating me for a sales position to think I am professionally. So what would I say if they would ask me – tell me a little bit about yourself. All right, right now I am in transition. I am really interested in starting a career with a great company to pursue a career in entry-level sales. I think that my ability to persuade people, my experience in customer service, my outgoing upbeat personality and drive to succeed I think are gonna be huge assets to me succeeding and surpassing sales goals to become a great sales professional. I think if I’m placed in an environment where I’m inspired; where I have the proper training; where I have the right environment around me, the sky’s the limit. I feel I fit really well. I think in the sales environment where it’s competitive would really play on my sports mentality side – the side of me that is really competitive and really wants to work hard and do the best that I can. A little bit about myself – awkward. A little bit in transition. I think who I am professionally needs a little bit of work. I should write it down in prose. That’ll be what I do on the train ride home now that I have an Android phone, I can record my thoughts on the go. I will work on my 60-second, 30-second elevator speech so I can have a successful interview tomorrow with Workbridge Associates. The good thing about this job – regardless if it’s sales – is that it’s in the city. You get to dress nice every day, shirt and tie, business professional environment. That’s somethin’ I would look forward to if accepted – also the opportunity to control my own earning potential. I think that’s one thing that is attractive to me about working in sales is that you’re gonna get into it what you put out of it. If I’m working hard, really engaging deeply, and absorbing what is being taught to me and the nature of the job, there is no reason why I shouldn’t be able to earn a lot of money, make a lot of sales, close a lot of deals. I’m excited to catch up on podcasts I’ve been waiting for. I’ve got some new updates. That’ll be cool. I really like the idea of podcasting, especially music on the radio. It’s so predictable and repetitive and almost stupefying. I can almost listen to something stimulating in a different kinda way – challenge me to think, give me important, relevant information.',\n",
       " 'Hello, my name is Gabriel Selice and this is a discourse on machines. I don’t know. I guess when I came in here and I took the capsule I started feeling things. They started hooking me up to this machine. It kind of gave me an uneasy feeling. I’m not gonna lie. I don’t know how I feel about machines so as I was thinking about machines. Machines are kind of a problem, I think. The industries that we’ve made and kind of the technology that we’ve surrounded ourselves by, it’s kind of like alienating I think. I think that it hides maybe what life should be about, which is maybe about labor and connectedness to nature and now I sound like a hippie but this is my feeling on it. Here’s an example, so I’m kind of like a socialist. I believe in these ideas and I have a friend that’s a socialist also and he wanted me to see this movie about this workers’ cooperative where these people all owned this business together and they made decisions together. It was a great socialist concept. So we watched this movie but the whole movie’s taking place in a factory and I mean, yeah people talk about how they have a vote and they’re like yeah this is nice but it seems like it’s still just this alienation because all that they’re doing is working in this factory and they’re making machines and just constantly surrounded by this lifelessness and I don’t think that’s what our life should be about. I don’t think that’s why we were created or what the meaning of life should be for us so I hope that in the future we can find some kind of way to take a step back from machines or just be more conscious about the machines we make and the effect that they have on people. Even the iPad, it’s very intriguing it’s very interactive but when you think about it, there’s somebody else like in China who’s putting all this labor in in this factory, this really oppressive alienating factory to make you this fun toy and even though it seems like this technology is so pure and innocent and educational, at the same time it’s built from the slavery of people that are definitely being exploited. I think one of the major apple factories in China recently there was this horrible explosion and all the workers died and all these questions about safety regulations came up and supposedly the same factory had a really high rate of suicide. So I don’t know, man. We gotta rethink what we’re doing with these machines, I think and then big ole Obama, he was talking to Steve Jobs before he died, asked him jokingly could you bring back some of the jobs like just a few jobs and Bill Gates, not Bill Gates but Steve Jobs it’s the same thing pretty much though, Steve Jobs laughs and says but no we’re not going to bring back any of those jobs and if anything we’re gonna replace their labor which is more machines. Well who’s gonna make those machines and once their factory is full of these machines, maybe like six administrators, what’s everyone else gonna do? They’re gonna work at McDonalds or the meat that they make in the lab or something? It’s troublesome so I see people moving from the countryside, which is a proven statistic, into cities to work with machines and arm machines and make machines and then we learn about machines and then we die maybe in a machine and then they’ll use a machine to burn us up or maybe use a machine to put us in a little box and then they’ll use another machine to put us into the ground or to spread our ashes and then we die and that’s it and maybe hell is more machines and heaven is like quite a pond. This is my feelings on machines. I don’t know. I guess the next question is what do we do with all of these machines? I don’t know. I think, that’s a good question. They would make a big museum of like, the machine museum, makes sense people can come and there would be this massive museum it would be the size of Los Angeles. People can come and look at all the machines we’ve made and how shitty things were. They can look at all these pictures of burning Apple factories in China, “Oh wow, machines, great.” Yeah okay, well the hippie has given his discourse. On this note, I have a good friend who decided to drop out of college and go to become a farmer. He’s actually become quite successfully. Right now he’s managing the farm in Illinois. His whole deal was that he thinks cities were just the worst idea ever conceived. Cool.',\n",
       " \"This time for the inner monologue. Okay, so what do I talk about? The thing on my mind right now is this thing that I started and I’m not sure if it’s gonna be successful or weird or what it is. I created like a Hegel Reunion group, kind of as a joke but also kind of as seriously I always wanted to read Hegel. I’m kind of like a gut Marxist like a Marxist sympathizer something like this Marx everything that he does is somehow connected to Hegel. He claimed that he turned like Hegel upside down in his own head, dialectical this sort of material and all these things so I’ve wanted to look into Hegel so I’ve convinced a group of 20 people to at least by word claim that they’re gonna join this Hegel reading group. Half of them I think don’t believe that I’m gonna be serious and just try to throw a party and I am trying to throw a party also but the other half are more intrigued by Hegel. So we’re reading this book called the Phenomenology of Spirit. It’s like 600 pages and this guy is probably the most obscure weird author, I don’t get any interest in actually convene his message to a large populace of people. So it’s difficult to read and it’s translated, I even convinced my girlfriend to read this book, I don’t think she knows what she’s getting herself into. I’m like on page seven and I had to read these seven pages like three times. I don’t know what the fuck I’m reading honestly. So I’m hoping I can get like a German or something to come to this thing and help us. If not, we can just have a German in the room and he can entertain us with German myths. Hegel, well there it is. I ordered this book. This French guy who’s done this, supposed to be very important, commentary on Hegel. This French fuck was like a Marxist. He was interested in the Marxist aspect of him and this and that, this and that. I don’t know, so that’s what’s going on. The other thing that’s going on is the NATO, hurrah. So NATO’s in town and all my little activity friends are all excited. I got friends probably on various sides of it. One was some catholic worker buddies. They got into the media recently for their action at the Obama campaign headquarters. I thought they did a wonderful job, a lot of love and spirit inside of those people and then the news. You never hear of Catholic workers on FOX news, Catholic anarchists crazy shit. My other buddy, I don’t know who’s kind of a hardline anarchist, he’s being hanging out with this black block which is kind of like the more confrontational wing of everything. They’re like in an alliance with anchapie but they've been around since the ‘90’s, their whole idea is their like militant anarchists, somewhat connected to the propaganda of the deed, I think. They’re interested in like property damage to corporate entities, confrontation with the police. They’re nonviolent but I think they’re pretty willing to go into self-defense like if a cop hits them I’m very positive that they will hit them back. My buddy’s been with them and they had an action yesterday right after an immigrant march where a priest was arrested. They had a response where 100 other guys, all dressed in black with masks on, were marching down on the south sides and saying fuck the police, fuck the police. They actually supposedly though got a positive response from the neighborhood they were in because they were in a neighborhood that experienced a lot of regular police harassment which is definitely well and alive in Chicago. So that’s interesting. I’m mostly gonna get involved with this organization I work with called From That Bombs. We feed the protest and every week we get a lot of food from local grocery stores to be thrown away. We cook a huge meal and give it out the produce for free. We feed the, I don’t know 60 to 100 people every week. We’re gonna try to do what we can to feed various contingencies of this protest passing out free vegetarian burritos and soups and bread. That’s the aspect I wanna be mostly involved with. I don’t just wanna just protest this NATO. I wanna suggest a better alternative. The alternative I suggest is a world where wealth goes not to killing people but to feeding people. So that’s sappy but this is what I wanna do. I say we’re gonna have like eight, four more seconds. Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah. So amazing, so pimp, super pimp. Okay, what else do I do? Alright, there it is.\",\n",
       " 'So yesterday was a great day, I think, in Chicago. It was Pride Day. Me and my girlfriend, she had her prescription picked up, actually birth control. I think we won’t get pregnant. we picked it up at this Julasco and we forgot that it was Pride Day and we were just fucking amazed by the turnout. She’s already seen it before. She’s from Chicago. I’m from El Paso, Texas. We don’t have that kind of shit really. We have a Pride Day but it’s nothing like that and I think as opposed to another kind of festival, this one was just so generous and community based and actually I considered it a great triumph over Fascism. It was like homosexual pride and even just switching gender ideas and kind of challenging patriarchy, which comes a lot of people in this community and the homosexual community. It was great. It’s good. It’s a bunch of bullshit I think the patriarchy is the origin of war and it’s crap. The one thing that made me sad though is that, I’m a Mexican American. My hometown is very homogenous I guess and I didn’t know about this Puerto Rican and Mexican kind of dispute and I was walking and there was this Mexican couple in front of me and there’s a pause in the line. We’re right next to some other dude. He looks Hispanic to me and he asks the other guy in front of me who is much more Mexican than I am or much more Mexican looking than I am. I don’t know how you can be more of something than the other person, he looks more Mexican so he asks him, “Hey are you Mexican or you Puerto Rican?” and the guy says, “I’m Mexican.” So he fucking puts his thumb down immediately. Obviously he was Puerto Rican. It’s sad shit. I don’t understand why this exists. I think it’s because their confused on one another a lot in Chicago but it’s really sad, not just because we’re all Latinos but because we’re all like fucking humans. You know and such a petty little, not even nationalism but the sport nationalism. Mexico and Puerto Rico have never had any kind of historic issue except in the Bronx. This is a sad thing to me, what else. I’m really worried about war right now. I’m really afraid of war. I think something’s gonna hit America pretty soon. I don’t think that our bubble of peace is gonna last forever and we’re gonna have to really come to terms with the kind of lifestyle that we lead, the kind of world that we’re in, what we’ve done to the world. I think a lot of when they raided Rome, the Goths, when they raided Rome. Different circumstances but still probably put into perspective, what roman life was and what that civilization actually was and what it really depended on. It did not depend on communities that turned it on the state, which was a falsified sense of community in actuality it’s the people around you that will be your network of support and people that don’t have that kind of relations to their neighbors. What will happen to them if there’s a war, if there’s a disaster? Will they be left alone? Will they die? Will their neighbors wanna help them? What will we do? How will we share food? Who will get more and who will get less? All these questions have to be decided or they will be decided, I guess, by what happens. I don’t know, this is too much maybe but I trip on this. I went to Vietnam, I guess is why. I spent four and a half months in Vietnam and I saw what the war did to their country and it completely destroyed that country and not even the fighting so much as the bombing. It was the bombing that did it. There’s so much poison in the earth so there’s so many forests that are still cleared. I remember this Vietnamese biologist said that every time he would see planes coming, he knew that there was more clear land because they would bomb all the forests where all the Vietcong were. Anyway, what’s my point, my point is that war’s shitty. Nationalism is shitty. Community is the only pimp thing that we have and that’s what I have to say. I don’t know what else to say, kind really talk very well right now. My thoughts are the chilliest. Mao Tse Tung. Vladimir Lenin. Karl Marx. Root beer. Dinosaur, Jr.',\n",
       " 'Monolog. Okay. Monolog. I apparently need someone to talk to, to have something to talk about. Let’s see. You can’t take a bicycle on the CTA trains during rush hour. That makes a lot of sense, but it’s kind of a pain sometimes. Questionable content. I’m using web comic. The guy seems to support himself with it, which is impressive, unusual. Short of Zuckerberg and the like, most of whom deal primarily in advertising, it’s hard to do that. Although I suppose that’s how he’s getting his money too in the end, is the advertising of his very popular book comic. But the fact is is worth writing home about, so to speak. Still here. Still here. 37 degrees outside. A gentle breeze at about 10 miles per hour. Humidity 46 percent. Air pressure – I’m not actually sure how you give the unit, 30 inches of mercury? Yeah, that’s how. No precipitation. What else do we got? Full moon tonight. The sun rose at 6:11 this morning. Sunset scheduled for 5:51 p.m. That’s 12 hours and 22 minutes of daylight. Not too shabby. I could go for more. A northern town. We’ll get it. I’ll be out of town this year for that. But in another northern town, maybe more. I’m going to go to Scandinavia and get real north. If you do that in Alaska, you wind up in oil town, despair, smog, a lot of really lousy roads. Delightful people. Not delighted people. No one really likes being up on the North Shore – North Shore, North Slope. North Shore is something entirely different. Yeah, good people. Oh, anyway, Scandinavia, its similar rates of suicide and alcoholism aside, I just feel like it’s a happier place, at least lacking oil deposits under the North Slope there. I know they don’t call it that. It’s something – the North Country in Scandinavia. What they’ve mostly got is astronomers and tourism and maybe some laughs. Don’t know much about them. Reindeer and whatnot. But boy, I don’t remember where I was going with that. Oh yeah, Northern Lights. That would be bad ass. Again, you can see them in Alaska, but unless you’re going for some mad contrast with the North Slope mess, which you might. I mean contrasts are nice sometimes, can be. Not into the whole – yeah, stuff with contrasts. Some of it’s weird to me. No judgment. Obviously that’s a judgment, but do whatever you want. Oh, good. I was about to read the weather again.',\n",
       " 'I think the last time I read the weather. Might as well. 54 degrees. 29.8 millimeters of mercury. 88.7 percent cloudiness. 90 percent humidity. Breeze at about 8 miles an hour. Looks like there’s still some weather parked over the city, if this radar is current. Could get up and look out the window to find, but I’m attached to something. Kind of looks like it will blow through soon. But that’s not what the forecast says, so it must be moving pretty slowly. So there’s been a video of a sewer explosion going around on YouTube. Looks pretty gross. Don’t know where it occurs, somewhere in Europe by the license plate on the cars. Trayvon Martin is also all over the Web. Goddamn shame.',\n",
       " 'Yeah, all that sciencey stuff you just said, I agree. Still awake. Nothing to say. Checking in. Not feeling very talkative. If I fell asleep, I’d tell you, but I haven’t. Still here. Yeah, still here.',\n",
       " 'Okay. I’m going to be going to Thailand soon. Really excited about that. Gonna be the first week of April probably going to be going. My roommate has some awesome connections with air travel stuff, so I’m gonna be able to get a one-way ticket to Thailand for $500 first class or business class, which is crazy cheap. All I have to do is wear a nice shirt and nice pants. When we get there, we might get turned down because it all depends on if there’s available seats in business or first class. But hopefully it will only take – I mean hopefully we will get that on our first try, but if not, second or third day, we can try again. You get on their awesome flight to Thailand first class or business class, which will be awesome. I’ve never done that before. It should be fun. We’re going to go travel around Thailand. We’re going to go travel around Bangkok. We’re going to land in Bangkok. No real plan on what we’re going to do. I want to hike a mountain. I mean I want to hike a volcano. I want to see things. Maybe see some Buddhist temples. I don’t know if they have those in Thailand. I think they do. Interact with the local culture, eat some local food. Maybe try some ants on a stick or some cockroaches on a stick or scorpions on a stick, bugs on a stick. Eat some weird food. Excited for new foods. Hopefully I won’t get sick. I’m going to get my malaria pills. Make sure to take those when I’m there so I don’t get Malaria and die. That would be bad. I’m excited. This is going to be a fun trip. I’m feeling really good right now. Definitely had some ecstasy. Ecstasy is awesome. Okay. When I get home today, probably gonna watch some TV, maybe watch a movie. Oh, I’m going to email Patrick about the sublet and have him email me the credit application. Get that to my landlord. Make sure everything’s all good so he can get our apartment for when we’re gone. Maybe have some other people visit the apartment to see if we can get a second sublet so I don’t have to pay for the apartment while I’m abroad. My jaw is really clenching. But it’s okay because I’m feeling really good. Grinding my teeth. Classic sign of ecstasy. Wish I had a pess-fire. I’d just suck on a pess-fire, would lessen the grinding of the teeth. Hopefully the comedown off ecstasy is not going to be as bad as it was other times. But not thinking about that right now. Thinking about how awesome it feels to be alive right now. I’m feeling good. Thinking about. How much I like her. How much she likes me. How awesome we are together. She’s great. I really like her. Not sure what else to talk about.',\n",
       " '. All right. So what I was thinking about before she turned the microphone on. I was thinking about ecstasy and how my manager, my assistant manager, Adam, told me once that he is a recovering addict, and he would do ecstasy sometimes at work. And he told me that he did ecstasy this one time at work, and he just – everything felt so good. He couldn’t just do anything. He just stand in one spot and just not move because everything just felt so good. Then again, I’m not 100 percent how he would interact with customers. That would be interesting, to go to work at Domino’s and be on ecstasy and have to interact with the customers. I would probably get so much more tips. But then I wouldn’t be able to drive. Because driving on ecstasy would probably be a bad idea. No, scratch that. It will be a bad idea. Don’t do that. Okay. So ecstasy is great. I really like getting it. Not looking forward to the comedown. But right now it’s still pretty great. I remember I told you last time that I wasn’t looking forward to the comedown. But it was actually not as bad as it was before. Other times I’ve had comedowns and I was just like really sad for a while. But this comedown was pretty, like awesome compared to those. I mean last week’s comedown was pretty awesome compared to those. I felt completely normal afterwards. Let’s see. Ecstasy is great. It brings people together. I want to do it with my girlfriend. But I don’t know if I should. Definitely not now. Maybe when we get back. I haven’t told her I love her yet. I don’t know if I do. I really like her, but I don’t know what that feels like. What does love feel like? I really, really like her, but I don’t know if I can – like I’m really scared about telling her I love her. Because if you say that, you can’t go back. I don’t know. I think I do. I don’t know if I do. How do I tell if I – goddamn, it’s so hard. How do I know if I do? But I really, really do like her. I want to tell her how much I like her right now. It sucks I can’t because I’m in this drug trial and I’m not allowed any contact with the outside world. But she’s coming over tonight, and I’ll let her know that I told Selena Yuse – Selena Yuse – I like that name – yes, I’m going to tell Vero tonight that I told Selena Yuse how much I liked her and I talked about her, and that I really like her, and nothing’s going to happen overseas. I’m going to come back. I’m going to come back and be with her, and we’re going to have a good time. Yes, we will. We’re going to move to Cali. I’m not 100 percent sure about that yet, but how she’s going to take that, but I really hope she comes with me. I’d really love to have her with me. She’s good. I like being around her. You know what? I really think she does make me a better person. She told me that she made me – I make her a better person. I’m happy when I’m around her. I’m not always happy, but usually feeling just normal, a normal feeling. But when I’m around her, I’m much more happy. I love hugging her and kissing her. I really like hugging her. She likes my hugs too. She told me. She has good hugs and a cute butt. Ah, she probably wouldn’t me to tell you that, but she’s got a cute butt. I like her butt. She’s kind of shy though.',\n",
       " 'Okay. I am sitting in a room with a TV. I kind of want to watch it right now, but I have to talk into this recorder. I’m kind of tired. Pretty sure I did not get anything besides a placebo today, which I’m cool with. But I’m kind of tired, so that’s not very fun. After this, I will be going to my old apartment to go pick up some stuff I left behind. After that, I guess I’ll just tell you the rest of my day. I’ll go to the eye doctor and have my glasses readjusted for my trip to Asia. After that, I will go to Domino’s and pick up money that my manager was supposed to leave me, my final paycheck before I go off to my trip. After that, I really want to go to DMK Burger. I don’t know if I will, but I think I will. I will probably go to DMK Burger and get a burger ‘cause last time I went, they were really good, and I want to have one. I’m craving one right now. Yes. I keep doing that sound. I don’t know why I keep doing that sound. All right, so after that, I will probably go home. I still have to go buy a few things for my trip. I have to buy shorts. I have to pick up my malaria pills. I think I had to buy something else. I don’t remember what though. I wrote it down, so I’ll figure that out later. Rivero might be coming over today. I’m not sure. I have some TV to catch up on. I’ll probably watch some TV tonight. Kind of bored right now. This is a lot more fun when you’re on ecstasy. Okay. Going to be doing the final session tomorrow, probably over the phone because I live too far away now to commute over here. It’s only been three minutes. I’ve got to talk for two more. This blue tape sticky thing on the computer is fun to play with. I’m unsticking it and sticking it back on, then unsticking it and sticking it back on, and unsticking it and sticking it back on. Okay. Sleep time. No, no sleeping. For science. This is dust on this computer, on the computer stand. A lot of it. It has not been cleaned at any time recently. Should get on that. The green couch is looking weird. I don’t like this color. I kind of want to keep watching Austin Powers. It’s kind of funny. There’s a droplet at the end of the distilled water bottle. It’s just hanging off the end. It has not fallen. Wait. Is it a droplet? Yes it is. It’s still there. The thrilling conclusion to has the droplet of water fell from the spout, is the answer is no. It has not fallen. It’s still there, just on the edge of falling. I don’t think it’s going to fall because it’s been there for a long time. Yes, it has. I finished up my move yesterday. Moved all my stuff back into my parents’ house. I do not have the apartment anymore. It kind of sucks. I really liked that place, but then again, I really don’t want to live with Bobby anymore and whoever the new person would have been. Yeah, so a clean break. Awesomeness. Okay.',\n",
       " 'Alright welcome to 103.2 WH20 the wave. I’m your host Ben Vannick and I’m doing my monologue. Just honestly having a monologue with a recording device is not very weird for me. I do this a lot. I’ll record myself actually at home in my apartment, sometimes after a long night or night where I’m hanging out with somebody. I’m kind of a night owl so if someone goes to bed before me or my friend takes off, sometimes I’ll just turn on my laptop and I have a really nice microphone because I record music and stuff too and I will sit there and record myself talking. I don’t know why. It just helps me get things off my chest. It’s cheaper than therapy right and I’ll just record them. I usually don’t even go back and listen to them unless I’m really curious. If I’ve been drinking or something especially I’ll go back and listen and be like, “Oh my God, what did I say?” But I know the last time I was doing it, the weird thing is I took a break, a recording break, to go to the bathroom or whatever and I was taking out the trash and there was a homeless guy on my back porch and I live like on the second floor of an apartment building. It’s really strange to see anyone up there who doesn’t live there, especially at 3:00 in the morning and he scared the shit out of me. He was very friendly and stuff, he said, “My name is Dan.” And it was a really cold night. This was, I think about a week ago. It was unseasonably cold though and he’s like, “My name is Dan, I’m homeless, do you have anything that you can give me to help me? I need food, I need something to drink or whatever.” So I went inside and I brought him, I came back out and I brought him a big bag of trail mix and I think I gave him something else, maybe like juice, like a bottle of juice or something and then he’s like, “Do you have any blankets or hats or anything?” And so I went back inside again and I came back out and brought him a really big thick blanket and a really thick pair of gloves and a stocking cap and he just seemed so happy. He was like, “This is a blessing. Thank you so much.” And we had a really brief conversation, the standard kind of pep talk like, “I hope things get better for you. Take care of yourself.” I admit I felt really good about that, I’m still riding the high from that a little bit. It feels really good to do something like that for somebody and then of course I went back into my apartment and I finished recording myself talking and I talked about it then too, so I’m kind of like re-recording it. I’ve been recording myself a lot lately. I’ve been recording my conversations with my friend Derrick too where we just have long rambling conversations. It’s mostly just for fun, like it’s funny stuff. We don’t get extremely deep or honest or you know. It’s not therapy. It’s more like comedy and we’ll expand on topics and stuff and what else? I’ve been recording a music album as well so I yeah. I’m not a stranger to the sound of my own voice. I’ll say that. I really like the way the new albums turning out, the music it’s way more like rock and roll than the last one. I’ve been using the drum machine a lot and I even have an electric guitar right now that I borrowed from my friend. It’s actually kind of a rock album and it’s really fun to record and I’m really taking my time with the songs this time, like I’m not in any hurry to get them done. I’m probably gonna have some friends play on the record too, I think I’ll probably release it on December 12, 2012 because I like 12-12-12, just looks good on paper and plus I released my last album on November 11, 2011, 11-11-11, 12-12-12 just kind of makes sense to do, kind of wish I could do it again but there’s not gonna be a 13-13-13 unless I just did, no, wait no none of that makes sense, no that’s not gonna make sense, there’s not gonna be a 13-13-13 or a 14-14-14 for that matter and so on. So I’ve been reading a book today while I’m at this session. I’ve been reading That is All by John Hodgman. It’s awesome I think it’s just some of the funniest, silliest writing. It’s so damn goofy I love it. I’m addicted to it I think I can just read it everyday. It’s kind of like the perfect writing for a person like me. It’s – alright, the end.',\n",
       " 'Captain’s log, ate a banana today, slightly disappointed, not a fan of bananas but any doubts I’ve ever had in my life about intelligent design, kind of go out the window when I look at a banana. It’s got a handle. You can open it up perfectly. It’s like it was designed to be eaten by people with opposable thumbs, pretty fancy. I mean, there are – you know, I don’t believe in God per se but there is definitely an intelligent design when you look at a banana or say a snowflake, hexagonically symmetric miracle of science, of nature. I forget what we were talking about, oh yeah, captain’s log. That’s the thread I was gonna go with today. Yeah, God, I’ve been having a nice summer so far, been riding my bicycle a lot, still recording my album which is taking forever but it’s really rewarding and fun to work slowly on something that you really like and really express yourself and not really worry about how it’s gonna sound to other people so much because it’s – I’m not gonna release it until December so it just seems like 1,000,000 miles away and it seems like a really – it allows me to be a lot more personal with the work. Just record things that I wanna hear and I think in the end it’ll be better for posterity. What else, been reading, Graham Greene, the comedian. It’s definitely a comedy its dark felt. It’s ridiculous. It makes me want to travel. It also kind of reminds me of Wes Anderson films, the way shots are framed and kind of the dry humor of it and the interactions with people, reminds me a lot of Wes Anderson flicks, like the dialog seems very unforced and I just recently say Wes Anderson’s new movie Moonrise Kingdom which was awesome. I loved it, it was – I found it like, his style, the reason his characters are funny is because they take themselves so seriously and I started to notice that’s what real life is like. Most people I know that are kind of funny to me are very serious people that take themselves very seriously and seem to not maybe be aware of how silly what they’re doing actually is. People at my restaurant where I work they take their job so seriously, just very tiny small extremely insignificant virtually unnoticeable things, taking them so serious, I don’t know if they see how funny that is. I don’t know if they can back away enough or get that bird’s eyes perspective but West Anderson’s new film, he certainly has an eye for that sort of thing. It’s basically centered around children too in that awkward kind of adolescent phase where you’re just kind of coming into your sexuality and – just he captured the feeling of that age really well where – the main male character is a khaki scout, like a boy scout and it’s very great because he basically runs away with this girl that he’s met and he’s living on his survival instincts and it’s great to see a kid who’s maybe 13 or 14, I have no idea I’m horrible at guessing kids’ ages but it’s fun to watch a 13 or 14 year old boy trying to act like a man. It is infinitely entertaining to me and I really relate to it and the female character, same thing. It’s great. It’s hilarious. I never heard of Bill Murray’s new movie either or Francis McDormand. Francis McDormand’s underutilized probably but man she’s great when she’s on screen in that flick and I can’t wait to see it again honestly. What else do I wanna talk about? I don’t wanna talk about comedy. I feel like I talk about it too much. I don’t talk about what I’m doing.',\n",
       " 'Welcome to KQ92, the morning zoo. I’m your host Mad Dog. Wouldn’t Morning Zoo radio be a lot more boring if people talked the way I talked? I don’t even think that was a believable mad dog. I don’t really know what to talk about much during this monolog today. I don’t really wanna ramble. I’m not in the mood to amuse myself. I’d rather be reading right now or maybe watching a movie. It’s strange because I think a lot of it is because I do this at home now where I’ll just record myself talk and it’s like an audio journal instead of recording, writing in a notebook. So now when this happens and you put this in front of me it’s just like, well I can just do this at home and I can say much more personal and horribly embarrassing things. It’s much more interesting and strange. It’s strange, now it’s like I would be wearing my pajamas in public as I say. Kind of the way I feel about – I still play guitar and stuff, like I’ll play guitar at my apartment but if I ever, like nowadays, if I ever leave the house with a guitar which is really rare, I feel like I’m bringing my secret out into the world, like I haven’t played – because I used to play music in front of people and now it’s like it’s my own little secret thing and so when I go outside if I carry it, it’s like I’m going outside in my underwear or something so strange. I don’t know why that is. I think that’s one of those insecurity things, like you just think other people, I think other people are leaping into assumptions when they see me with a guitar like, “Ugh, he thinks he’s so great.” No, I don’t even know what the connotation with the guy that carries the guitar around anymore. For me when I see it I’m like, I wonder what kind of guitar that is? So I don’t know about the general population and I never have. So I guess what’s going on this week is I started a new job which I’m not totally stoked about but it seems like it’ll be good money, in a restaurant but going to do a standup competition and it’s so hard to make myself do a standup competition because last year when I had really just started getting decent I didn’t move on in a standup. I lost the standup competition basically and I already hate the concept so this year’s just like, dang it, what am I doing this again for? But a lot of people say that’s what you have to do if you wanna start getting more gigs and stuff, you have to win one of these fucking contests. It’s so awful. I’ll tell you why. Standup is an art form. It’s really just an ancient art form of talking and entertaining fashion, trying to make people feel good or think or laugh or whatever and then you put it in the arena of competition, it’s like who’s the best at making people think and laugh and feel good? It’s so strange. Basketball is a sport, agreed? Yes, you agree. Basketball’s a sport, there’s a point system you win or you lose, whatever there’s some rules that you can bend and you can blame it on the referees but with comedy, it’s just like this free open forum. It’s just talking really. It’s so strange. I really think it might be the weirdest thing in the world, a standup competition. It’s like who can tell the most jokes, who tells the funniest jokes, how subjective is that? Oh, my God. Who seems the most natural on stage? Yeah, you can seem natural on stage but it doesn’t mean you’re funny and once again funny is subjective. These things are awful. So I’m gonna have a good time. No, it’ll be nice. It’ll be an excuse to go down and visit family and friends down in the southern part of the state or the middle part of the state. It’d be nice to see my buddy Joseph because we had a weird kind of – he didn’t talk to me for a while, like we got in a fight which is really rare for us and we finally talked it out over the phone and now I get to see him again for the first time in a couple of months and it should be good, should be really good. Get to see my buddy Lewis, he’s a wild ass, see what he’s up to. It’s actually really nice. I need to get out of the city.',\n",
       " 'Okay. Well, I moved to Aurora in September. Stayed with some family there for a while, ‘til December, and moved in with my roommate, who I met at Reggie’s, the job that I had when I first moved here. And that’s going pretty well. Finding a job is stressful. Unfortunately, I don’t have a job right now, which means I could possibly move back to Richmond. It wouldn’t be a terrible thing, but I should definitely be able to make it here in Chicago I feel like. I don’t really know what to talk about. I think I might have taken some MDMA, a very small dose. Not feeling too many effects of any substance at the moment. Let’s see. The difference in the Midwest and the South I feel like, back in Virginia, people are a lot rowdier. Don’t mind being a little dirty. Here it’s like people are a little more clean cut and I suppose polite or proper, I suppose. I don’t know. But definitely a different vibe between people here and there. Let’s see. I haven’t eaten yet today, so I feel like the images I see for the image test, I respond more to food than anything else. Yeah. This is weird, talking to myself. All right, what did I do last weekend? Oh, Friday I went to a loft party and ended up being a volunteer for a guy with a bull whip. He had me hold up a piece of paper and he kept whipping it in half until it got smaller and smaller. And he ended up cracking me in the knuckles with the bull whip. So it was a pretty interesting party. Let’s see. I noticed Chicago has a lot more electronic music. But I guess that’s to be expected, since it’s the birthplace of house music. Yeah. Surprisingly though, I’ve noticed the club scene here, people don’t usually do drugs, which is kind of what I’ve grown to associate with electronic music, is you know, like ecstasy, ketamine, things like that. But it’s actually a whole lot more prevalent in the South, like in Virginia. There’s a pretty big electronic scene there between Richmond, Baltimore and DC. And yeah, people there like do mass amounts of drugs all at once. However, I try to limit my use. Any time I do a psychedelic drug, it’s only once every three weeks. Or not every three weeks, but I wait at least three weeks until I do another one. It usually ends up being only a few times a year that I actually do it. Is that it?',\n",
       " 'All right, let’s see. Started a new job last Thursday at this place called The Crocodile in Wicker Park. It’s kind of like a trendy bar. They have like a lot of dance music and they offer free pizza. So a lot of people come in for that. Yeah, bar-backing is like one of toughest jobs in the restaurant business. So it definitely keeps me busy. The pay is pretty good. The boss is kind of a hard ass. He kind of talks down to everybody, but what can you do? I do a pretty good job, so he doesn’t have a whole lot to say to me. You know, it’s pretty good. Free food, free drinks. I work about five days a week already. And everybody there has been kind of impressed by how well I work. So yeah, it hasn’t been a problem getting shifts. And yeah, that’s about it. Hopefully I’ll be there for a while. And yeah. Let’s see. What else? Oh, I went and saw a movie last night. Cabin in the Woods. It was kind of goofy. It was like a goofy horror movie. It’s about these like college-age kids trapped out in a cabin in the woods, where these people would kind of play puppet master and watch them and make scenarios happen. And it was all in order to turn the kids that were in the woods into a sacrifice to appease ancient gods that they were trying to keep from destroying the world, which I thought was a pretty neat concept. But the way it was done was pretty funny and kind of goofy. Pretty neat take on a horror movie, I guess. What else? Talked to my friend Ryan the other day from Virginia. And I’m trying to get down there for this music festival called Starscape. So right now I’m just trying to work out the details and save up money to get a plane ticket to Virginia. Get down there a few days early before the festival. That way I have time to visit friends and have a good time with them before I go to the music festival. That would be really good. Overall this summer should be pretty busy. Well, I’m really bad at the talking test. Guess I kind of just feel like I’m sitting here talking to myself, which is weird.',\n",
       " 'Well, as usual, this is my least favorite talking task. I don’t really have a whole lot to talk about. Usual stuff I guess, work, sort of saying about work. It’s been getting busy. On Saturday we fired a bar-back in the middle of our shift. So I ended up having to pick up the slack. It ended up being really busy. But my boss who’s normally very – well, he’s kind of a hard ass – he was actually patient with me because he understood, you know, that I was picking up most of the slack. And yeah. We’re going to get some new bar-backs in there that I’m going to start training on Friday. And I’m glad that I’m training them because I feel like now that I’m there, I can actually weed out people who are just going to come in and be useless. Let’s see. I guess I still need to look for another job during the day, a couple days a week, to get supplementary income. Let’s see. I can’t wait for the weather to stay consistently warm. That way I can go swimming. The lake should be a lot of fun. Let’s see, what else? Hopefully if I can save up enough money, I can get a plane ticket back out to Richmond for a while and go visit. That would be really nice to go just visit old friends and have a good time there. It’s definitely a lot more laid back than Chicago, so a change of pace would be good. I don’t really have a whole lot else to say. I am almost certain I am on MDMA right now. How much time is left? Oh sweet, it’s five minutes. #1293_SER228.s1.Monolog#Charles# Oh, my where to begin talking about myself? Okay, well I guess I will say that what’s been going on in my life. Well, as I told Charles earlier, I recently got a new job and so this past week I have been in training all week sampling some very, very good food and just studying a lot and trying to gear up for my final test that I have tomorrow on wine and beverage which I’m a little nervous about but overall I think I’ll be okay. I’ll probably spend the next rest of today and part of tonight kind of studying like to get set at 2:00 tomorrow so I don’t really have to rush and I don’t really have to worry about being in uniform so I can pretty much study all the way up to the end and kind of like walk in and I’m ready to go to just like put that stuff down on paper but probably will continue to review everything even as I go along and for the upcoming week after that, on Tuesday I have my final walkthrough. Then I start on the floor on Thursday in a two table section which will have experienced serving. So the regular section is a four table section which I’m sure that I’ll be up to pretty quickly and just looking forward to that because it’s a very very high volume busy restaurant which means a lot of revenue for myself so that’s what’s been going on and probably going to be moving within the next month, just ready for a change from my apartment, something definitely a little bit more modern. I did an episode of Boss with Kelsey Grammar about two weeks ago which was pretty awesome and I have an audition coming up, a singing audition coming up actually this week so hopefully that’ll be something else to talk about when I come back in. Just looking forward to really hitting the audition trail even more and getting some new headshots for myself to send out to some casting agencies here and I’m looking forward to finally being able to hang out a little bit more because over the past couple of weeks I’ve just been really really busy so I haven’t really hung out with any friends or anything and probably going to go home for Memorial Day if I’m not working obviously and if my mom and my aunt don’t wind up coming here to visit because I’ve been here for about six years now. I’ve gone home the entire time and they haven’t come here once but that’s a different story but the economy hasn’t been that great either but anyway. Let’s see, what else? I really don’t know what to say. Everyone at my job seems very very nice and they really seem like they want, especially the managers too but then again I haven’t started yet but everyone seems very nice and they’re really very much, as one of my managers said, wanting to set us up to be successful so that’s a good thing and I think it really helped as opposed to some other places that I’ve worked that – It was very much hands on type of approach with all of the training. My last place that I had training at, I’m not gonna say where but I guess because I came in towards the end. They really weren’t too concerned about training me that well but it’s just kind of like, it was just a bunch of walkthroughs and I really didn’t get a chance to see the food, taste the food, taste the wine, taste the beer where as opposed to here I did. So it really kind of gave, for someone like me who’s very very visual an opportunity to really put the item, not just on paper but in my mind too and I think that’s important too especially when you’re going to a table and with it being such a touristy type of restaurant, a lot of things that we may have people may not have had before so you kind of have a firsthand approach, a firsthand knowledge rather of what it is that you’re selling to them that they’re about to eat, they definitely will be more inclined to buy.',\n",
       " 'Okay well, I – what to talk about? Well, I guess I’ll talk about my week. I had a very good week. It had its ups and downs but yesterday was my first day on the floor for my new job which I had a couple of kinks but like my manager said that’s to be expected, that we make a few mistakes but in the bigger scope of things like the majority of what, was it, to do, run my food, well we have food runners but help out with the loop, drinks need to be ran, food needs to be ran as well and if we put out tables with our tables and stuff, making sure that they’re taken care of because I accidentally forgot to send something right away so the food runners said that I would have to. I needed that with my actual entre orders but nevertheless everything was for the most part overall pretty good because no one’s food didn’t get put in so it’s not like they were sitting there and not having anything in front of them and just remembering all those things as far as in training that we had is far different acronyms that we have for different things but the low part was I was supposed to have an audition, a singing audition, for this dance competition thing that’s gonna be coming up. It’s going to be coming up in August and they need live singers that they actually want to have with the dance show. Unfortunately, where we were gonna have the auditions, that room was closed but nevertheless he was like, “I’ll reschedule.” That’s good because I was actually very eager and ready to do that but I guess, kind of as a warm up I went out with my friends on Tuesday and did karaoke and I don’t know what it is but it’s like a couple of, I guess that’s with anybody’s, a couple of libations and I just, give me the mic. So I just went up there and I sang and it was so funny because I went and asked my friends, “Well, how you think you did?” and people would come to me and was like, “You know you sung and you have a really great voice. You completely changed the vibe and the dynamic.” Because a couple of people that went before me they were so Debbie Downers I was like, oh my gosh. All of us were like, “Will you still love me and care for till me tomorrow.” I’m like nobody’s coming out at 11:00,12:00 at night to want to listen to that, okay? They wanna come out, have a drink, here you sing something upbeat, get them moving and then get back to the DJ. I mean really but nevertheless I did what I do and it was so cool because it was a live band and stuff and as soon as I went in, like we just fell into each other and it was just like, they just came in right with me, ended when I wanted to end, it was pretty cool. So that was fun and what else? Yeah, just looking to auditioning more because I sent out a whole bunch of stuff and getting some new headshots and doing another comedy show, looking forward to the weekend too because I’m scheduled to work and I’m sure that it’s gonna be pretty, pretty nice, excuse me, getting up to my four table section but even after last night my sales and stuff are really good so he was like, “I’m gonna put you at three.” So hopefully by next week I’ll already be at four, I’m really excited for what’s to come in the next couple of months or so because you know, it’s good to really refocus and really realize what it is that you’re supposed to be doing and then what else happened? I was so thinking that Mothers’ Day was this Sunday and so I’m like running around before I had to go to work and like went to the store, it’s like gotta get the cards a Mothers’ Day for my mother and also for my grandmother because she just had knee surgery a couple of weeks ago but the physical therapist and all that kind of stuff was like she’s a very strong woman, strong person, runs in the genes but nevertheless I got those and put them in the mail and I felt so good about that and then when I was hanging out with my friend, he didn’t even realize that it was Mothers’ Day. I was like yeah, I think it’s this weekend.',\n",
       " 'Okay, what to talk about? Well, is that glass or no? I’m so curious if this is glass or not. It is not. I cannot stop yawning, my goodness. Okay, what to talk about? Well, relationships for one. They’re a great thing to have when two people are on the same wavelength but when they’re not, it’s not a great, great feeling. Just getting out of what would have been a six year relationship and I don’t know what happened but it happened so gotta move on. I cannot wait. Everything together for my apartment, that’s what I’m really excited for, just getting a whole bunch of stuff for it because I’m going after this to get the rest of my stuff but I’m excited to get all the stuff for me so that’s one thing that I’m very looking much forward to and getting my TV and microwave, TV stand. I really wanna know. I have to go back and see if that TV, if they can mount it, that’s a mountable TV or do you need a TV stand because if so then I’ll just hold onto that and then, I keep saving for I’d go for and I don’t care a really really nice one. They’re not that expensive. For sure. I tell you some of that stuff in here is just like oh my God. There’s roaches and shit on the fruit and shit. That shit’s gross but it’s part of the exercise. That’s part of life actually so. Now I gotta get my stuff. I’m so grateful that somebody is gonna let me borrow his car. That way I’ll be one fell swoop of a trip. Just ready to do me, that’s it, just ready to do me. I’m done with relationships. I’m done with trying to make other people happy and in the process I’m not being happy within so that time is over, that lullaby is gone because at the end of the day you got you, yourself, you got me, myself and I. That’s it. It’s like you can’t – I don’t know. Maybe someone will get back to me and that will happen for surely it will happen. No, I don’t want it to. The biggest part is I don’t go out. I don’t do nothing. I don’t wanna stay home. I wanna go to the gym and train. That’s it. That’s it. That’s all I wanna do. People get on my nerves. Do good in our very most organic form but it’s like everybody just ugh, I don’t wanna drink, I feel like people like my friend for sometimes, how can you sit up there and say I like you blah blah blah and the next thing you’re like, don’t even wanna say anything. It’s like I don’t have time. I got more important things to and shit do. Oh my goodness, what does it want? I had not fallen asleep. I’m just here thinking that I need to tinkle.',\n",
       " 'Okay. Alone in a room and talking to a tape recorder, and I don’t even know what they’re gonna use this for; whether anyone’s ever gonna listen to this for content. Um, hmmm… I feel like I’m talking to someone’s answering machine, and now I’m starting to ramble. Um, hmmm… Let’s see. My plans for this weekend. I’m going to go to Holman, which is hell and back from anywhere. Um, it’s amazing that I have to take a Metro train to get to someplace within the city boundaries, but that’s the CTA for you. Um, I’m going to go see a sort of art festival down there. One of my friends, um, a sci-fi film maker, is showing his 19 minute film there. He’s trying to get funded right now for, uh, a TV pilot, which would be awesome. Um, Chicago isn’t exactly well-known for its, uh, science fiction. Mostly known for and the man with the golden arm to literary things that I’m not terribly excited about. Um, hmmm… God, this is boring, talking to myself. Um, it’s just like being stuck in my own head, except, um, I’m moving my lips. I could try speaking French to myself to keep myself better entertained. Um, let’s see. Uh, there’s this – I could describe the contents of the room. That would be good practice for – oh, there’s a baby monitor there. What’s that, in case I get too high and fall down and hit my head? Um, the couch is kinda stained. It looks like they got it off of a dumpster. That’s – they used to have that in my university all the time, but you wouldn’t think that would happen at the University of Chicago! Um, let’s see. Got some books on the table. I wish I were reading a book right now instead of babbling stupidly to myself. Um, uh, there’s a poster over there, pretty boring looking poster. Um, I’m wearing a brown corduroy skirt, long, and a white peasant blouse which my mom bought for me. Um, I don’t particularly like it, but it’s rolled up at the sleeves so that, um, it’s not bothering my cast. I have a broken thumb; somebody jumped me a few weeks ago. The funny thing is, I don’t really feel anything about that anymore. I was really angry because I lost my job because I was imprisoned in the hospital. I say imprisoned as if they were somehow being unkind; they were just trying not to get sued by keeping me there too long. Um, any way that might – but right now I just don’t feel anything about it whatsoever. It’s weird; it’s like it happened to somebody else. I haven’t been sleeping very well, however, since then, but I’m not sure if that’s – I don’t know why that is. I think I’m over-stimulated. I have a friend who was mugged and she said like even after she stopped being scared, she just felt on edge all the time; like your central nervous system is just – just – because, well the thing was, I got attacked from behind so I never got a chance to fight back. Probably my brain is still waiting for its chance to fight back. Of course I’m an insomniac anyway; it’s terrible. I just can never get my brain to shut up, even when I’m left alone in a room with nothing but a baby monitor and a box of Kleenex. Well, it’s generic Kleenex. Um, um, um… I’m sitting in front of a Dell computer. Dell computers suck; those are always the computers that they give you at work when you have a crappy job. Um, my computer is a Toshiba. It was cheap, too. Of course it’s running pretty slow lately. I’m not sure if that’s because of my crappy internet or just because it has a virus or something. Um, wow, I’m really, really, really being boring right now. Um, hmmm… Uh, I could sing. No, I couldn’t, my throat feels a little weird. Um, I like my cat. Cats are fuzzy; cats are very fuzzy and adorable. Um, I’m looking forward to the art thing this weekend. I like my friend a lot, and I like his girlfriend, too. Um, we have a lot of fun together. God, I sound like a six year old. Um, um, let’s see. Uh, speech patterns – they’re probably trying to study my speech patterns. I should try to be more helpful, but I really don’t feel like I have anything to say. Um – oh good, I was just about to bore myself to death.',\n",
       " 'Alone with the tape recorder again. I wonder what they’re using this for. alone on the tape recorder. Um, let’s see. Dear diary, right now I’m flicking dirt off my pants even though that was on there. I didn’t eat breakfast today; what could I have possibly gotten on my pants? Um, let’s see. Plans for my weekend – I don’t really know what I’m doing for the weekend. The people I would wanna do something with are pretty busy. One of them is working on a film project, the other one just lost her job – isn’t that awesome? Seems to be going around; seems to be a huge epidemic, actually. If unemployment were contagious, wow. If unemployment would be – were contagious, that would be one hell of an expensive virus – I mean, anti-virus, whatever, vaccine. God, I can’t – why am I having aphasia today? I had it yesterday in court. I couldn’t remember the word for file. Heesh in French, and he said, “Heesh,” and I couldn’t remember. Oh shit. I mean, I can visualize it; I can’t remember the word. Of course a couple of weeks ago I forgot the word aphasia. I must be getting old. Um, let’s see what else. I feel like an – kind of an idiot, talking to a tape recorder, but if I can manage to keep talking the whole time, maybe I’ll keep myself entertained. Let’s see. When I go home I wanna do some yoga. I’ve been doing a lot of yoga since I got attacked by some random person. It seems to be helping – it seems to be helping more than yoga ever helped anything before in my life. I used to just do it because I figured if I did it enough eventually something would happen because so many people do it, so I’ll try it. But – and it seemed to, you know, help make me more flexible in my hips, which is always nice if you have a desk job or aspiring a desk job, ride a bicycle or what not. But – it actually seems to be helping me psychologically right now, which is good. Maybe I wasn’t screwed up enough before for it to actually have any obvious effect. I thought I was screwed up, but now I’m really screwed up. Finally, yoga works! Or maybe I’ve just – maybe it’s just a coincidence, and I’ve finally done enough yoga to know how to do it right, to make it – oh shit, I wonder if I left my yoga candles burning this morning! There’s no way I could’ve; I only got two of them lit because I decided that I wouldn’t have enough time to do it. And also exercising when you’re not allowed to have breakfast is probably a bad idea. I don’t wanna fall down the steps because then I’ll faint with hypoglycemia or something. Not that I’m diabetic, but if you just don’t eat you can get hypoglycemia, too. Um, oh shit, I’m wearing three perfumes at once, aren’t I? I put this perfume oil on yesterday and I forgot that if you don’t take a shower – which I didn’t because I didn’t work out this morning because I didn’t have anything to eat – um, the perfume oil sticks on you. And then I sprayed cologne on myself. And then I used this deodorant that’s basically a perfume, so I’m just a – heck, good thing there aren’t any dogs in the room! I’m just a cornucopia of weird artificial smells. Actually, the perfume oil and the deodorant were both natural, so – It’s just the that would probably give the dog. I’m sick of talking to myself; I wanna go read my book now. I really like ; I wish I knew what it was so I could ask to have it prescribed. It really relaxed me. I like this pen, too. I’m writing, “I like this pen” to entertain myself. I hope it doesn’t screw up the results.',\n",
       " 'Alright, off we go; another boring monologue task. Um, I wonder if anyone is ever going to listen to this. Um, what am I gonna do later today? Oh God, I have to talk to that crazy movie producer. He’s crazier than a shithouse rat. I really like the guy, but wow – his job makes him insane. He never sleeps, he just never sleeps; every time I see him, he’s in this stage of like weird blinking – and oh, he’s always on the phone, too; that would make anybody crabby. He’s never gotten angry at me, but I must not be that irritating. But he does tell me that he breaks about five phones a year because he keeps throwing them across the room. But then again, he does have to deal with movie stars and shit like that; that’s gotta drive a person up the wall. Movie stars in financial stress – never had financial stress in my life, not having any money is easy! You just hope you don’t get evicted. my parents are still alive; I can always go live with them, so I don’t stress out about it too much. Although God knows the last thing I wanna do on earth is move to Wisconsin, but at least I won’t die in a cardboard box somewhere unless I really piss them off. Even if I really pissed off my parents, I’ve got plenty of friends. I hate to be not compassionate, but sometimes when I see homeless people, I’m like, did you piss off everyone you ever knew who had a house? Really? Then I think, oh you nasty person, and maybe everyone they ever knew is homeless. Maybe all their relatives are dead and all their friends are other homeless people. It could happen… Who was it? There’s that quote – it was online, so it was a printed joke, you can’t really tell it out loud. But he had typed, there but for the grace of God go I, but he had struck out “the grace of God,” and wrote in “pure dumb luck.” At the same time, I don’t know if I’m capable of pissing off everyone I know who has a house. But then again – okay, I’m talking in circles, talking to myself. This is why I need this job and a boyfriend so I can get out of my own fucking head, quit talking to my cat all day. I need a boyfriend for other things, too. And oh yeah, the money from that job, that’ll come in terrifically handy for appeasing my landlady. Not that she wants to kick me out – she loves me. But you know, eventually, I gotta go. Um, especially after I got so shitfaced at her last Christmas party. But geez, I was drunk and depressed and it was something free – fine, it was free booze and not something actually useful, but it seemed like a good idea at the time, until I fell into the refreshments table. Maybe I should have eaten something before I went there. But I thought there would be more hour devoirs, and less disgusting hour devoirs. As I recall, they weren’t very good. Which is kinda weird because she has good taste in many, many things. It’s not like she was stinting on a booze expenditure, my God. Um, let’s see. I wonder what drug they gave me, I don’t like it very much; it’s making me nervous. Or maybe, like I was saying before – maybe it was just a placebo and I’m just really hungry. I had a bagel at 6:00 AM; now I’ve been jittering for three hours. I don’t think that was a placebo. God, I’m boring. Um, guinea pigs, guinea pigs, cats and rabbits, dogs, funny bunnies. Sex – sex! Finally having sex again, isn’t that awesome? Like anyone wants to hear about that, yeah. If anyone is ever gonna listen to this, that’s probably the last thing they wanna hear me talk about. Um, I’m Baby Cakes – that’s an awesome cartoon, Baby Cakes. Look it up, if anyone’s listening to this. Brad Nealy is the name of the guy who does Baby Cakes. It is funnier than hell. He refers to cats’ paws as “hook socks.” Hook socks – I think that’s what I’m gonna start calling my cat, Hook Socks. “Come here, Hook Socks.” Oh good, I was running out of things to talk to myself –',\n",
       " \"Um, so I'm very excited about going home this weekend. Um, my one and only brother is getting married, so that’s very exciting. Um, his fiancé is a doll. She’s very awesome. Um, and it’s really nice to actually see, like, good relationships and someone in love and getting married, especially with all the not as good relationships out there. Um, so, yeah, the wedding’s gonna be this weekend. I get to see some of my old friends who are coming into town. One of them is Carol and she’s – she’s pretty cool. She’s, um, probably one of my oldest friends. She lives in Tennessee now. Um, she’s doing some – some psychology work and working with children and hopefully she’ll be getting her Master’s soon. Um, and so she’s gonna be in town and I haven’t seen her in a while. Um, I also get to see a lot of my family, which I haven’t seen in about a year, so that should be fun, too. Um, generally, it’s gonna be – I think it’s gonna be a good time. My family is very chill. They like to hang out. They, um – they don’t take anything too seriously, so I expect it to be a very, very nice, blessed, and wonderful event. Um, and then after that, or before that, I get to visit some of my friends in Cincinnati, and that should be pretty fun, too. Um, I’m gonna get to see – hopefully I’ll get to see people I wanna see. My friend, Steph, she’s, um, in Cincinnati in her last year of school and I didn’t get to see her over the summer probably for like six months almost, um, because she’s been in Europe studying abroad. Um, which was really good for her and I got to talk to her and she seems like she’s changed a lot, and for the better. She has this whole new outlook on life, which is really nice. And then hopefully I’ll get to see my friend, Christina, and I’ll get to see my friend, Jay, and her girlfriend. They’re also another really good couple that I like to hang around because they’re good people. I always like to have a good time and they’re real – no craziness and that’s really good. And then after that, I’ll be back here, which should be fun. Um yeah. A couple weeks ago, I went to the Lollapalooza concert. That was pretty fun. Um, I’m reading Spin magazine and they have a lot of featurettes on it and there’s a flashback of – for me, it was a flashback of going to the festival. I like music festivals; I think they’re pretty cool. Probably one of my favorite pastimes. Um, there’s good people. Generally, it’s good people and, you know, everyone’s there to have a good time. Everyone’s there to listen to music and just be in each other’s awesomeness, I guess. Um, so, yeah, it’s good for the soul to do something like that because not only is it fun, but also you get connected to a lot of people you’d otherwise probably wouldn’t be seeing. Um, and it’s people locally and also from around the world. So that’s pretty nice, too. Um, hopefully I’ll be going to another music festival soon, either in Chicago or somewhere else. I’m hoping to go to another one before the end of the summer or at least before, like, winter time rolls around. I’ll catch one of the last ones of the season. Um, and yeah. This is a pretty cool recorder. I’m gonna have to get me one of these.\",\n",
       " \"All right. Um hi. My name is Alexis, also known as Lex. I go by a lot of aliases. Um, my friends call me Dee; that’s my nickname in college. They also call me Lexington New Jennings, Lex Box 360, and various other random nicknames, which I don’t know where they got these from, but, yeah. Um, I am a Libra. I'm very balanced. I like justice. I like good people. I like clowning around. Um, I like brightly-colored things, neon colors, flashing lights. My favorite color’s magenta. Um, I like tennis shoes. I like sneakers a lot. I like flip-flops, too. I will wear heels if you give me heels on a good day, but I like sneakers. Um, I also like college football. I like being outside. I like music and going to music festivals. I'm pretty sure I said that last time, but that’ll tie everything in. Um, so, yeah, there’s that. I'm really excited for this upcoming weekend. I'm going to the Northcoast Music Festival. Um, it’s in Chicago at Union Park. Be there or be square. It’s gonna be a lot of fun and good music. Um, I was originally planning on going to New York City to go to the Electric Zoo festival with some of my friends, but I don’t have enough money unfortunately, but that’s okay, because we will meet again in due time and I’ll still be here and have people here to kick it with me and to spend time with and it’ll be a nice, relaxing weekend. I’ll get to sleep some because I didn’t get to sleep that much last weekend. So I’ll get to sleep some. I’ll get to hang out with my roommate before he leaves and maybe do a little bit of art, a little drawing. I’ve been working on making my own, like, do-it-yourself projects. So I have all these, like, old light bulbs and what I'm supposed to do is take, like, an X-Acto knife and just cut the top of it off and then I’m gonna stick little LED lights and I'm gonna make my own little lanterns to hang across. Um, so hopefully this works out. I like do-it-yourself projects, too. That’s one thing also that I like. Um, so I’ll do that, decorate my room a little bit more, um, and just, you know, hang out. I’m young. I can hang out. That’s what you can do. It’s the end of summer; it’s the last chance we get before all this cold comes in, which I'm not too excited about. But yeah. I see over in the corner there that you have the book, um, History of Love, which is a really good book. I read that a couple years ago and actually did a project on it when I was – one of my first years in university. It’s very well-written. One of my favorites. Great love story. I'm a sucker for love stories, but this one just – it’s very, very good. I recommend the read if anyone hasn’t read it. History of Love, Nicole Krauss.\",\n",
       " \"Hello. Um, all right, so let’s talk about something. Um, new things going on in my life. Um, I'm currently in the middle of switching roommates. Um, my old roommate, which I adored completely, he’s moving out to a bigger loft area space so he can do, um, some, like, art-type stuff. He wants to do art and business management, so he wants to kind of build this whole art collaborative or collective area where, um, he can have everyone, like, people come in and participate in art and maybe do, like, some art shows, host out of town people, and also have just like this big art open community, which is great. He has really a lot of good ideas and I hope that they all get off the ground, but it’s all starting with this loft area that he has. And it’s gonna be really, really cool. I was actually really happy because I found him on Craigslist when I first moved here and that could go either way, meeting someone on Craigslist, but he turned out to be really, really awesome and I'm really glad we’re gonna remain friends. Um, and I have a new roommate moving in, my friend, Rosa, who I actually met last year on my birthday. So we’ll be celebrating our Friendiversary soon and that'll be really fun. Um, she’s really rad and she’s really cool. She’s from Canada, she likes art, and she likes expressionism. She likes really quirky things. She’s very intelligent and very different. And I'm really excited to see how this year goes because she’s gonna be really, really cool as a roommate. Um, hopefully in the near future I’ll be getting some more money coming my way. A better job and I’ll be able to move into my own space. That'll be great. I love living with people, but it’s definitely about time that I live by myself and get the hang of that. Um, yeah, so that’s about it. Pretty excited for the fall to come. I know that winter’s getting closer and a lot of people are getting winter anxiety, but we still have a whole season – or rather a whole month – before that happens. Um, so that should be – fall should be a good time. I love fall, especially in Chicago. They have lots of really cool scenario and lots of – all the trees and all the flowers and stuff like that look really, really good. Um, maybe I’ll start taking, like, pictures or something or photography. That'll be my thing to do for this season. Um, other things to look forward to, I have some friends coming to visit in the near future. Hopefully that'll be really good seeing them. Hopefully I’ll be getting out of Chicago, either at Christmas or Thanksgiving. I like the city, but sometime you have to get out of here. Um, let’s see what else – I'm excited about new possibilities also in the coming fall. Maybe doing some, um, work with production houses or something or doing some film video or making a movie. That would be a good summer – err, not summer, sorry – that would be a good fall activity. Or maybe, like, getting on the radio or something; that would be pretty cool. It’s time to learn something new; that would be great. Have you ever heard the song ‘Heart That Races’ by Dr. Dog? If you haven’t, it’s a really good song. I suggest you take a look at it or take a listen. Dr. Dog is really good. I like that band, but the song’s stuck in my head now, so that’s why I was singing. I wish I had a better singing voice and I’d sing it to you, but that’s not gonna happen right now. Sorry. All right, that’s it.\",\n",
       " \"And it's 12:36. And um, I guess I'm feeling fine. I was in kind of a bad mood when I got here, but I don't really know if like – I just – I don't know if I feel like normal now because of the pill I took or because I just chilled out since then. Um, at first I thought – like I don't know if I'm on like an actual drug or if this is a placebo. I've been like trying to figure that out the whole time because I mostly feel normal, but then I'll like randomly catch myself like – all of the sudden I felt really cold. And like before all of a sudden I felt really talkative. But it doesn't really last and overall I kind of feel fine – like just sober, I guess. But um, yeah. This room is pretty plain. It's kind of weird that there's like a really big VHS collection here because I haven't really watched a VHS in a long time. Um, maybe you guys should upgrade to DVDs. That's just a thought. Um, yeah this room is like really boring. And I kind of feel like I've been sitting a long time so my butt hurts. And I kind of feel like getting up and walking around the room, but I have all these things attached to me. And I'm plugged into a machine, so that'll have to wait. It's been really nice out the past couple of days. I don't really know what to talk about. Um, I'm kind of thirsty but the bottled water I got here is warm and it's kind of nasty and tastes like plastic, like it's been in a hot room for a while. And I'm not – I was hungry earlier, but I'm not hungry at all now. But I should be because I haven't eaten in a long time. So yeah, maybe that's a sign that I'm on something. Because normally I'd be starving right now. Um, the tasks are kind of boring and it hurts my eyes to stare at the thing in the middle of the screen, the like white cross on the black screen kind of is like bothering me and kind of giving me a headache to keep staring at it. Um, yeah, the girl doing the research is pretty chill. She's nice. I am not 100 percent sure what I'm going to do today. Um, yeah. I don't really know where I'm going to go after this. Probably home because I brought a heavy bag with me. And I remember the last time I was here I was really cold. And I knew I was going to be doing nothing for a long time, so I brought like a little blanket with me. But I'm not actually using it. I'm not really using anything I brought with me, so I kind of like wish I hadn't brought this big heavy bag with me. And I also kind of overdressed for the weather. It ended up being nicer out than I expected it to be, but usually it's really cold at 7:00 in the morning, uh, during the winter. I had to leave my house super early to get here and I still ended up being an hour late. I left at like 7:45 and I was supposed to be here at 9:00. And I cannot – like the guy at the desk told me it was on the second floor and I was already like 20 minutes late. And the elevator didn't go to the second floor, so I was going to all these different like freight elevators and staircases and like trying to find where this lab was. And then like after like a half an hour – and the people here were calling me and I was trying to call them back. And I like could not get through. And then I asked a security guard where this lab was. And he told me it was on the fourth floor and then that we had to go down to the first floor and then back up to even get to this side. It was really frustrating.\",\n",
       " \"Um, hi. I don't know who's listening to this but I guess I'm just supposed to talk into the recorder. Um, I feel like I need to introduce myself but that's kind of irrelevant. Um, so this um, this time I got a blue pill and it looked really big. And it was a little bit hard to swallow – well, compared to like the allergy medicine I usually take, it was. And I'm pretty sure this pill was like the Cannaboid pill, even though I don't really know. I mean, I know that it has something to do with THC but I don't know like what the fuck that actually means. And I'm guessing that's what I am on because I don't really feel anything except like really sleepy and like I keep zoning out. Like, um, usually if I'm like not talking or doing anything I'm at least thinking about something. But if I'm not focusing on anything then my mind is just blank. That's how I felt since I took the capsule. Like my mind – if I'm not doing anything, then my mind is just blank. I don't like have any thoughts in the back of my head or anything. Um, yeah. Uh, I have the sensor on my neck that's kind of bothering me, but it's not a big deal. It's just kind of irritating. Um, and – yeah. I don't really have anything interesting to say. Um, I just talked to Selena about my 11-year-old cousin, and that was pleasant. I was afraid that she was going to – because the three people I listed were my best friend and my cousin and my boyfriend. And I was like nervous that she was going to ask me about my boyfriend. Well, he's not really my boyfriend right now. But I was nervous she was going to ask me about him because we're fighting right now and I really didn't feel like getting on that level of conversation. So, yeah. I got to talk about Cindy and – that's my cousin. And, yeah. I haven't checked my phone in several hours and, um, been on the computer. I've just been watching Austin Powers, which came out when I was like a really little kid. I just noticed there is like popcorn on the floor under the desk, like popcorn crumbs. And it's kind of gross. Well, I mean, only because like at school in my dorm whenever like – well, my freshman year I lived in a building that was connected to a building with like, um – with our cafeteria. So if you like had crumbs and stuff on the floor, you basically were guaranteed to have like a mouse in your room. So that's what I just thought of when I saw all the popcorn under the desk on the floor – was like oh no. Mice and ants – but I'm sure that probably won't happen. Um, there's like paperclips on the floor, too. Yeah, I really don't know what to talk about. I keep coughing. I was coughing during the, um, the test where I look at faces and pictures. And she told me like not to move very much. So I hope the coughing didn't interfere with anything. Um, I wish I had something more interesting to talk about, but yeah. I mean, I feel like as long as you're listening to this recording and like using it as data, it might as well be at least not bor – d – like horribly boring to listen to. But I mean, it is what it is. Um, I just hope I get out of here before like 3:00 because I'd really like to be home by like – I mean, at the latest – I mean I want to be home as early as possible basically because I feel bad for my dogs. Usually I'm there when my mom is at work to play with them. But they're going to have been put away in their room – they have to stay like in a room. I have two golden retrievers, because otherwise one of them will poop everywhere. I think my times up. #1293_SER235.s3.Monolog#Selena# Hi, my name is. Um, I don't know if you're like listening to these tapes. I've done all these last three times in a row or what – and you already know who I am, or if you've already had to listen to me talk. But yeah, this is my last session. And of all the three sessions, I definitely, um, feel the drug the most out of this one. So yeah. Um, I really don't know what to talk about. I just feel like everything I talk about I sound really goofy, because once I start talking I start talking really fast because I'm probably on ex. Or uh – yeah, I don't know. They said like the different ones that I could possibly be on I think when I started were like a Cannibus pill or a v – or like a sedative or a placebo or ex. And this time I'm definitely on some sort of upper because I was like really tired and hungry before and now I'm like really awake and can't think about food at all. But um, yeah. Wow, it's only been a minute and a half. That is crazy. Yeah, time is just going by like really, really sl – I feel like time's going by really slow because I would rather be like moving around and doing stuff but I'm all like fidgety and hyper. Like I want to talk but I don't even know what to talk about. I'm sorry. I keep – I feel like hot now. Before I was like really cold. But I know if I take my sweater off – well, okay. I'll take my sweater off and I'll let you know if I get cold. But every time I've been taking my sweater off – or like, I don't have it on – I was cold. And now I'm really hot with it on. I'm like super antsy and fidgety and just like want to get this over with. And this game I have to play next is the worst. I hate this. It's like – it's like not a fun computer game at all. Like I'd rather be playing solitaire. I would so much rather be playing solitaire. Um, I'm good at solitaire. Well, I'm not good at it, but it's like entertaining. I'm good at it enough to keep myself busy. I also want to get the computer games over so I can paint my nails because I brought nail polish and I'm looking at my nails right now and I would like them better if they had the teal nail polish on them that I brought with me. Well, it's not really teal. It's like Tiffany blue, if you know what that is. Like the Tiffany's box. I don't need to describe this to you. But yeah, it's Tiffany blue and, um, I don't even know how long I'm supposed to talk for, or if I even need to be talking this much. I figure why not talk if they want me to. I might as well. This reminds me of when I had a – well, it doesn't really remind me of it, but it kind of reminds me of in high school I had like a podcast that I would do for fun and my friends would listen to it. And some people from my school – but it was always like goofy recording it because it wasn't live. I would always have to record it on my computer and like listen to myself talk back and like cut parts out or edit it – or like add sound effects and stuff. And it was just really annoying to listen to myself talk so much. But I don't know, it was a good time. Other people thought it was a good podcast. And I had a radio show, too, my freshman year of college on my school's radio. Um, channel – yeah. It played like rap and electronic music. It was cool, I guess. I think this is almost done. I think I talked for five minutes and now it says f – like four and a half. If you talk for more than five minutes, I really don't have anything left to say. Sorry. I keep yawning. I'm – like my body's tired but my mind is like awake. It's a weird feeling. I think this will stop at five minutes or they'll come back in here or something. Nope, it's still going.\",\n",
       " 'Alright. So yeah, I’m feeling really good right now. The past few days have been kinda down. I got back from New Orleans, and like that was – that was awesome. You know, it was warm, and it was around – it’s just, I love traveling and meeting new people and just new experiences. And I really wasn’t looking forward to coming back to Chicago. I’m really ready to go on with my life and travel and things like that, but there’s still some things I need to take care of, so – yeah, I was feeling kinda down the past few days. Not like extremely down, but I’m a pretty upbeat person, and um, yeah. I like to think that I’m like – have a lot of electricity in my life. You know, things always – things are always interesting anyway. You know, and I hate to think of things going stagnant, but yeah. Um, but yeah, I’m feeling really good right now. I’m planning on traveling to New Zealand in like a month and a half just to live. You know, and I’ve never done anything like that. You know, I’ve gone different places, but I’ve never been outside of the US. And um, I don’t know, it’s kind of intimidating – like, what do you really want to do out there? Um, but – I have a friend who’s there, and she said we could go on this crazy hunting wallaby thing, but um, yeah, I’m kind of having trouble reaching her. I don’t have a telephone right now, and I don’t use Facebook. And uh, yeah, she’s in Australia, so hopefully we can meet up. But if not, my Grandma said that there’s like all these sheep farms that I can stay at. She is from New Caledonia. I have a bunch of family from New Caledonia. It’s like this little tropical island right by Fiji, and I really wanna go there. And I really wanna learn French, and that’s kinda where I’m at right now. I’m not even trying to learn French, but I really want to, um, because everybody there speaks French and, um, I wanna go there and meet all – a lot of my family, and yeah. I wanna learn how to sail and surf, and be in the sun. I think the sun is really important. Um, I don’t know, maybe I just use it as an excuse sometimes, but I really do think there’s like a great healing power in the sun, and that – you know, it’s not only like metaphorical, like, oh this is, um, like sunrise and sundown. It’s what the earth revolves around, and I think there’s something really powerful to be said in that. Um, I like being outside; I like being in the sun. I can like sit in the sun, I like – you know, always try to like – I was a lifeguard for a little bit this summer. I was camping, and like hitchhiking and like living really rugged all outside for part of the summer, and the other part of the summer I was a lifeguard. So I was outside all the time, and I could just feel so – all the magnitivity of it all. Um, I don’t know, it was great; it was like things were really in tune and synchronized and everything was going the way it was supposed to. I was supposed to meet somebody – well, not supposed to, but – it would be really convenient if I met somebody right now, and I would. And everything was just really in line, and it was really awesome; it felt magical almost. I think people – I really have a lot of potential and a lot of capability that, um, I think we shrug off. And that’s one thing I wanna learn, is I wanna really harness that part of myself, like the intuitive part, um, yeah. Just to be more connected to everything around me. I think that’s one of my goals, is to really see life for what it is. You know, the short beautiful thing that is happening. And um, just to love it, you know? And I – not to be apathetic or sad or bored because – I mean, that’s like, how could we be bored right now? There’s so much going on all the time! And it’s a little overwhelming, and I kind of feel like I’m really used to that, uh, that kind of lifestyle – always go, go, go, something new to do. But I’d like to take a break for a little bit and maybe work on a sheep farm or goat farm, or go backpacking in the wilderness eating wallabies for a little bit. I think it’d be good for me. Because I’m not going to school right now. I was going for a couple of years, but I wasn’t really learning the things I wanna learn, and I understand that I’m at a real pivotal point where I should be challenging myself and learning things that I wanna learn, and developing myself as an adult because, you know, for like 18 years I was living at home, and didn’t really have an opportunity to do the things that I wanted to do, so yeah. Am I done?',\n",
       " 'Alright, uh,. So, yeah, this weekend has been really amazing. Um, I’ve heard music my friend Simon and we went and we were busting on Six Corners and it’s so fun. And everybody gathered there was so much electricity. We were just going crazy and we like we just feed off of each other and started screaming and dancing and like singing and banging on things. There was just so much energy. It’s a really high energy experience. Yeah, when I was with him it’s just like man, I’m gonna miss him so much he’s leaving, and then I’m probably leaving. I don’t know, it’s just, um, yeah, he’s just a good person to have in my life, and I feel like we’ve never really, um, I’d just like to live with him really. Um, yeah, so I think things have gotten kinda weird with that ‘cause I thought he was like truly into men, and then he told me I was the love of his life. But I think he has a lot of loves of his life, so it wasn’t anything like too big, but yeah, it’s cool. We, uh, kissed each other and that’s But, um, then I stayed the night at. It’s like this commune in uptown. There’s like 500 people living there in this old hotel, and we fell asleep after we were, and Simon’s mom actually woke us up, and she said, um, that Ant was here. And Ant stayed with me, um, for a couple weeks last year or this year, or maybe just a few months ago. And, uh, he’s like just travels around, really rustic, lives in the woods, things like this. And so he was around, and that was amazing ‘cause we were just literally talking about him a few hours earlier randomly about how we wanted to see him, and then he came into town. You know, he like – he travels everywhere, and I didn’t know he was in Chicago, so that was a nice surprise. So now he’s staying with me, um, at the Butt Hole, that’s the name of my house. Yeah, I mean it’s pretty soothing. It’s a fun house. There’s like a bunch of people in and out. Um, there’s definitely a lack of amenities, but that’s okay I think. Um, you know at least for now, I mean, forever however long. Ant was telling me like all of these ways to get alternative energy like wind turbines, mini wind turbines, and pocket turbines and crystal and bowls and you hook it up with light bulbs. I don’t – crazy stuff. Um, I’d like to get more into that. We’re pretty rustic at the house kind of. I mean, um, we don’t squat or anything, but we pay rent, but we dumpster dive all of our food. We got – oh my gosh, we went dumpster diving yesterday, and we got 12 chocolate cakes. They’re like mini gluten free like fancy cakes. So that’s exciting. Um, we also got a bunch of vegetables and, um,, and so Ant made really good food. And we didn’t have a bonfire, but we usually have bonfires. I started spinning fire and sometimes when I close my eyes I just think of Poi just like dancing around me. And I hoola-hoop a lot, and I used to think that way about hoola-hoops close my eyes and think of Poi and different Poi moves. I actually had a dream about it last night. I was watching some girl do it, and just like doing all the moves I know. And I just started it, but it’s really fun. Um, my friend Marie she has fire Poi, so we spin fire and like bang on drums often in the backyard and it’s cool. I really like Marie. Um, yeah, ‘cause usually I’m just like around a lot of men, and, um, just it’s, you know, it’s not a bad thing. But just being around females a lot is nice too. I used to live with all girls, and I don’t think I like that too much. I was kind of caddy, um, but I like to mix, you know. I think I’d rather live with a bunch of boys and have to deal with like piss on the toilet and like have it kinda messy than like caddiness. ‘Cause I am pretty chill I think, and sometimes people think I’m inconsiderate just ‘cause I don’t like – what I don’t think is a big deal they – they do. Um, but I’m going to Peoria today, and I’m leaving tomorrow I’m not sure ‘cause Simon and Ant are both here out of nowhere. And they’re leaving tomorrow, and Simon’s leaving on Thursday. And I have a lawyer appointment, an appointment with a lawyer. And so it’s like a full day, um, on Wednesday, so that will be fun. And I get to go back there again for Thanksgiving. I’m really looking forward to seeing my grandma, and my father I like to do crafts with him, and have heat. We don’t have heat at the Butt Hole. It’s ridiculous. They want me to put it in my name. I don’t know about that we’ll see.',\n",
       " 'Alright. Well, Mrs. Dewitt, if you are listening to this, you have fucked me up. This research I’ve never anything like it before it’s insane. I like couldn’t even – oh my gosh, there’s just so many, um, senses at once, like – just like waves and like my vision I was kinda hallucinating. It was intense. But, um, I’m gonna talk about what I’m thinking about. So I’m moving to Hawaii in like three weeks. Um, it’s gonna be kind of, yeah, it’ll be – it’ll be amazing I can’t wait. I don’t know what it’ll be. I’m just going. I’m flying standby whatever island I end up on that’s the island I’m on. And, um, yeah, so we’ll see how long I’m gone, what I do, what countries I go to blah, blah, blah. Anyhow, I’m embarking on an adventure. Um, but it’s kinda like before I have an adventure I have like, um, people here I really care and I love, and I wanna support, so, um, I wanna. Yeah, this is about the place I’m living at. It’s called the Butt Hole right now, and they’re like amazing. They’re really cool and fun and, um, very good musicians. But you know none of them have jobs. You know what, that’s fine. If you can exist in this economy without a job, that’s great you know. They’re doing different things like squatting and dumpster diving and you know just like really utilizing the waste of this country ‘cause it is a lot. So lately they started to steal bikes and I – I do not support this at all. I think you know they ride bikes everywhere that you know these people are your comrades. You’re stealing from your community and, um, and it’s disgusting like – I don’t know and it’s sad to think that they’re like so desperate they have to do something like that. And I’m just worried that you know I’ll be gone, and there won’t be like a good female influence in their house anymore. And, um, ‘cause Nahi is another good female, and she’s in Peru until March, and it’s like these boys are gonna have all this time to themselves, and they’re just gonna get in trouble and cause mischief. And it’s like nothing good’s gonna come from that. Like what you’re gonna get a bike and then sell it for money, and then eventually you’re gonna get caught and you’re gonna get arrested. And nobody needs that. Nobody wants that and like it’s not punk rock, it’s not cool like – it’s just a shitty thing to do, and I don’t respect it at all so. Yeah, I’m gonna write them a letter and put it on the refrigerator once they get home because, yeah, it – it really bothers me. It does. Um, but, yeah, I keep like bouncing and like trying to keep steady. Like initially when I took this I was like oh my god this is really intense what the fuck this is crazy I don’t know what’s happening. And then I was like oh yeah and it was probably a dissociative. You know what, I just looked at the time right now and it’s 325, and almost every time I look at the time it’s 325. Well, not even just time I just see that number all the time 325, 325, 325, 325, but, um, that’s my birthday, so I think it’s a good thing reminding me of me. Um, yeah, so I’m like kinda bitter sweet because I’m going without Julie and we were gonna go together and it’s beautiful. But you know what, I’m – I’m excited, and I think she’s really excited for me. She’s in Oklahoma because her dad’s going to prison, and you know she’s just hanging out with these people who just, um, don’t really see the light in themselves. I think, um, so I just want her to be well and happy and come and travel with me. I’m so excited to go to Hawaii. It’s gonna be amazing. I’m not even that nervous. I just – I know it’s something I have to do some sort of like spiritual pilgrimage if that makes sense. Um, life’s really easy up there, so I’m really excited. I have some friends there on Maui, but I don’t know if – I don’t even wanna go to Maui first. I wanna go to an island I haven’t been to. So we’ll see where I fly into. I’m thinkin’ Oahu. One time I did this like ritual – this tribal ritual drug called I-o-was-ka, and like I ended up meditating really intensely. And the whole time there’s like this beat – this sound in my voi – in my body like – like going in my core it was just saying Oahu, Oahu, Oahu, and, um, yeah. So I – I think I should go there, but we’ll see what happens. You know, go to New Zealand. I’m – I wanna work on my French, Bon jou, mona mi. That’s all I know. Merci bo cu, Coma se va. I just know a few phrases. But I’m gonna go to. I’m gonna hang out with my grandma everyday and work on my French. So I’m excited for that. Okay. I think Lindsay’s about to come in to take this from me. Yeah, there she is. Okay, bye.',\n",
       " 'Um, so I’m very tired right now. Uh, I don’t really know – I don’t think I’m feeling anything anymore. I’m just really sleepy. Um, at first when everything started I was pretty, uh, I was a little more energetic and awake. And then gradually I got pretty tired and that’s where I’m at right now. Um, I still have two hours left, which I’m – oh actually I have an hour and a half left. I just can’t wait to get this over with by now ‘cause I’m so tired. Um, what else should I talk about? After this I’m just gonna go back to DePaul where I live on campus, and hopefully take a nap and get ready for the night. Uh, tomorrow I have to go in to, uh, the Leggo store because I applied there, and I have to talk to the manager. Um, I’m supposed to introduce myself to her and stuff and show her that I’m energetic and whatever, um, so hopefully I can get the job. So it’s a good thing I don’t have to do that today. Uh, and then I start my Monday classes, which I haven’t – oh actually I’ve had ‘em – I haven’t had my Tuesday classes yet, so that’ll be interesting. I’m really excited to go home and see my roommates and talk to them about today. They’re super interested in this whole experiment, so research study or whatever you wanna call it. So I’m excited to explain to them what happened today. Um, everything is pretty comfortable. I’m pretty happy with how this whole this is run. There’s – I was never like comfortable – I mean uncomfortable or like really scared or nervous about anything, which is a good thing. Um,, the only thing I don’t wanna do is take the L home. That’s gonna be a long ride. Uh,, I’m just so tired I don’t even know what to talk about. My future, I wanna be a night therapist, maybe, I’m not sure. I kinda wanna look into that. Um, but I’m not really taking any classes for that at DePaul right now, so it’s kinda stupid but, uh, uh,, um, oh, it’s my brother’s birthday today. I have to remember to call him. That’d be terrible if I didn’t, but he’s in Vegas, so he’s havin’ fun anyways. Um, how much longer do I have? Let’s see, it’s my parent’s anniversary tomorrow, so I have to remember to call them as well and wish them a happy anniversary. It’ll be their – it’ll be their 19th anniversary, um, so that’s good. And my mom called me and told me that, uh, she got my father marijuana for it, which is super funny ‘cause I mean they don’t – they’re not – they don’t normally smoke it. But she – my mom is just a goofy lady, and so, uh, yeah, she’s gonna call me tomorrow and tell me how that goes.',\n",
       " 'Okay, so these tasks are taking forever, and I’m getting pretty frustrated. Well, not really that frustrated. I just am getting super bored, and I just, um, it seems like last time it wasn’t as like long and hard for me to like sit here as it is this time. I’m getting really restless and whatever, but, um, um, yeah, that’s basically how I’m doing right now. I just wanna get outta here again and just go home. Um, yeah, yeah, so I don’t know what my plans are for this weekend, or – I’m going back home on Sunday to be with my family and to see my, uh, cousin, my new baby cousin who’s like two months old. And, um, so, yeah, that should be fun. Um, this past weekend was awesome. Um, I went to, uh, and Sunday night and it was one of the best shows I’ve ever been to. Um, they – just was amazing, so – and they really threw down ‘cause it was their 14th birthday. Um, um yeah, I don’t have much else to say. I hate this part of the research study, um,. Let’s see, next weekend my boyfriend’s coming to Nepal. Um, he goes to Eastern, and he has a three-day weekend, so he’s gonna the Amtrak down and stay at my place. Um, and then I don’t know. I have no idea what we’re gonna do but, um, I’m so bored. I just want this to be done. I still have two-and-a-half hours of this. I’m getting pretty anxious. I’m ready to leave. uh, my five minutes are up almost. I can smell somebody cookin’ some food except I’m not hungry at all, so it’s okay. Um, I probably shouldn’t be touching these cords, but I am, oops, um, yeah, I don’t know. I wanna be doing something like standing up and doing something like at a show. I would love to be at a show right now. Hmm. Or just partying tonight I can’t wait.',\n",
       " 'Okay. So today was an experience, um, there was a girl and, um, I don’t know I – I guess like I think things were like kinda going wrong for her. But she just couldn’t get like the sensors on right. But, you know, we’re done in the end, so it doesn’t matter. Um, I just kinda hope I get out. I like to like last time ‘cause last time it went like everything was on time I’m pretty sure, and, um, I got out exactly at 2:00. And I kinda wanna do that again today. Um, just ‘cause I have a mid-term to study for after this and everything. So, um, yeah, I’m happy to be done with this research study after today. Um, it was fun, but very repetitive so I’m ready to be done with it. Uh, I’m not very talkative right now. I was before. I was very talkative before but now I’m like feeling kinda tired. Just a little worn out. Yeah. Uh,, I’m excited for the weekend. My boyfriend’s coming. I’m excited to see him. Uh, we don’t have any plans yet, but it’ll be fun just for him to be in town. Um,, I’m dreading the commute back to the hall. It’s kinda scary. Um, yeah. Um, my shoe broke on the way here. That’s gonna be a pain in the ass to get a new one. Um,,. Everything’s going super slow today. Like I feel like it’s been ten minutes that I’ve been sitting here. It obviously hasn’t even been five yet. Um, yeah. I’m ready to start watching Billy Madison again.',\n",
       " 'This is weird, talking to myself. It’s 11:35 AM, Wednesday, the 2nd. After this, I am going to a poetry reading and then a workshop, and then dollar beers. And now I’ll be heading to that stupid picture thing. I wanna adopt a cat because there is the hurt kitty, made me very upset. So, I might do that. Read about sociology of gender. Watch the new 90210 episode which should be out. It’s exciting. It’s a good show. How about those bears? I’m not doing too well. It’s so uncomfortable. One time when I was seven, a slug crawled into my drink and I accidentally ate it. It’s pretty gross. My nose Halloween, it’s very depressing. No intercept at school and didn’t get to go trick or treating because apparently people don’t do that in the city. I did carve a pumpkin, made pumpkin seeds trying to be the best soup. And then Thanksgiving is coming. I get to go up to Yale. And, yeah, that should be fun. East Coast. My five minutes should be finished any second now. Yay.',\n",
       " 'Okay, I’m not feeling super chatty so probably gonna sit in silence for the next five minutes but I’ll say something every now and then so you know I haven’t fallen asleep. Still here.',\n",
       " 'All right. So after this, um, I’m going to go home and kind of got to make a decision on how I feel. I probably won’t feel like napping like I felt earlier in the morning which is good because I need to mail some eBay packages which I claimed were shipped yesterday, but they weren’t and – because I’ve been a little lazy and distracted, since I just moved here recently. Um, and I didn’t have all the packing materials that I needed when I needed them. Um, and my neighborhood is not the best for, like, stores. Um, anyway, uh, so I got to do that. My friend Tanna wants to video chat with me at some point which, hopefully, I can work in. I might have to do it way later because, um, I got to figure out, like, eating time, and I don’t know when my friend Chelsea wants to meet up, but I’m helping her with a video at SAIC because she’s a student there, in the green-screen room, and her and her friend are doing, like, this yoga video thing which has to do with, like, keying out different things with the green screen and then their bodies – it’s like kind of cool and not really my thing exactly, but it’s cool. Um, and, holy crap, the facilities as SAIC blow my mind. Um, I mean there are some things that I can see more positive about the school that I went to. And it was cheaper, too. But – and I guess that maybe SAIC doesn’t really, like, teach that much technical stuff to the students is what my friend was telling me because I was complaining about that about my school. But the things that they have are amazing like the green-screen studio – oh, my God. I wish that I could have that. It has, like, amazing lighting. It’s just crazy. But, uh, SAIC is also interesting because of the security there. At my school, at PMCA, like, uh, you could just pretty much walk in, like anybody could definitely walk in. You didn’t have to, like, show them your ID or anything. And there you have to, like, scan your ID, and then if you’re with somebody, like if you don’t go there, you have to, like, give your state ID to the security person, and then they have to, like, fill out a thing on the computer and take a webcam picture of you and print out a thing with a barcode. It’s just, like, Jesus. Um, what else? Um, I’m supposed to get an email later about a job interview that I had yesterday for this, like, t-shirt place. Um, it’s not entirely ideal and what I want. It’s, like, similar to my last two jobs, which is, like, kind of cool. Like, I think I’ll get hired because I definitely, like, fit in, and, like, the guy definitely liked me, and he interviewed me, like, right away when he called me yesterday, since I wasn’t available today. And then, uh, he showed me, like, around the store, and then he said that he’s gonna set up a second interview, so I’m going to get an email from him later to hopefully do that. And I hope it’s sooner than later because I don’t want to end up getting, like, possibly if I get hired by the UPS store, which I interviewed for earlier this week, I really just hate accepting a job and then, like, having to call back and then, like, turn it down or, like, the idea of, like, working a day and then, like, turning it down is weird because I’ll definitely go with this t-shirt shop over it. I don’t even know how much the UPS store pays, but the t-shirt shop pays well, like, $10.00 an hour. I mean it’s better than my last job, so – and that isn’t – that’s like higher than minimum wage, and then they raise you to $11.00, and they have benefits, like – it’s pretty cool. I thought it was going to be more embarrassing to – the idea of working there. I think I just hate the name of it or something, but after going there it was, like, cool. And all the people were, like, really nice, um, which is also another thing. And another reason why I like living in Chicago, since I’m new here, um, people here are like really nice. I mean obviously it’s a big city, so there are, like, some people who aren’t as nice, like, why would they be, but – and I think that that’s part of why it’s, like, impressive how nice people are because you would expect everybody to be, like, rude or something, like, that’s just like a preconceived notion about a city, but, like, people are so friendly and, like, sociable here. It’s really awesome. And, like, in a – it’s seriously the nicest city I’ve ever been in as far as people, like, sociably go, like, I haven’t experienced too much of kind of like young kids that are all, like, cliquey. But I could go out a bit more, which would be cool. And I’d like to meet more people for sure.',\n",
       " 'All right. Uh, last night I went, um, to an artist’s talk kind of thing. It was, like, uh, kind of Internet artist, and he was giving, like, a lecture and, um, with a presentation and showing, like, websites and stuff. And he did a guest blog for Art21, and it was pretty interesting, and he was kind of talking about, like, ownership and, like, and, like, uh, he brought this documentary where they kind of talk about if, uh, technology is, like, ruining or, like, fostering creativity. And, um, like, a lot of Net artists and even two of my favorite artists, which are Eva and Franco Mattes, they’re kind of interested in, like, um, transparency and, like, having no privacy, um, because the Internet kind of embodies that, and that was even what, like, my thesis at school was about. And so this guy was kind of about that, too. And I had never heard of it before, but apparently there is, um, there are these communities on Facebook where you can join them, and then anybody can proposition you, and then you can exchange passwords with them. Um, and for, like, I don’t know, a certain amount of time, I guess, you would do that, and, um, you can just go on their Facebook as you feel. Um, but they have a raffle at this gallery space, I guess it is. I’ve been there before. And the last time I went, um, I think that the artist must choose what the prize is because the last time it was one of those blue mad dogs, and, um, I know that that artist was really into, like, blue. So he definitely picked that, um, and obviously the artist last night did because he gave away, um, his Facebook, Twitter and his artist’s website passwords. Um, and I won it, so I get to go on all those things and do whatever I want with them for the most part until January 1. And as kind of a deposit, I gave him my Facebook password, and I just feel like it’s just pretty much perfect for me, for my interests. And I’m really excited about it. And I could have also – we – we have, like, a contract, and I could have put down, like, he can’t look through my messages or something like that, but I was just, like, I don’t want to put anything down, and I just want to see where this goes. And I don’t really know what I’m going to do yet entirely with everything. I’ve been on his Facebook, and I, like, added two friends. And, um, uh, and he has been on mine, I think, now, but, um, I don’t really know enough HTML right now. I know a little bit, um, but I think I’m going to have my friend that went with me last night who’s, like, way better at that stuff go on his website at some point with me, and then maybe I can, like, figure out something to do on there. And I’m definitely going to do, like, some self promotion. I, like, brought that up – if I could do that – and he was, like, definitely. He said that I could even make his website my website, um, so I might do something like that. I was thinking I might change the name on the website to just be mine or, like, and/or put my email and then see if people email me. And then if there’s anything important, I would forward it to him because, I mean, I feel pretty respectful of all that, and I think he’s – he’s probably hoping that, and I’m sure that he’s going to respect, for the most part, my Facebook, but – because he seems like a trustable guy, even though you shouldn’t technically trust anybody, I suppose, but that’s fine. It’s the Internet, and it’s kind of an experiment, and I think, in the long run, it’s going to be pretty interesting. Um, I still have time to talk, and I feel done with that. Um, let’s see. Maybe I’ll talk about today a little bit. Uh, after this I guess I’m going to go home, and I’m hoping that my landlord will give me my – a copy of my lease already because it’s been like a month, and I need it in order to get a parking permit. Um, though I left her a message this morning, um, telling her that I really need it, like, immediately, um, and I’ve been using temporary permits, so I really need, uh, the real thing, already, um, because I’m almost out of those. It’s almost been a month since I got those. And if I have to get more, it’s just going to be, like, way too expensive, and the permit already is like – the guy told me that it would be like $100.00, and I’m not – I really don’t want to change my license plates because I just renewed my registration in Oregon in, uh, April, and I spent like $120.00 or something on it. And I don’t want to have to do that here.',\n",
       " 'Um, okay, um, I don’t know what to talk about. I mean I’m not doing much later that I have planned. I guess I’m going to apply to more jobs. And I know I’m not supposed to talk about anything stressful, but, uh, that’s just an underlying stressful thing going on right now is waiting on jobs, trying to find a job, blah, blah, blah. Um, other than that, um, hopefully maybe cleaning my apartment, which I’ve been pretty lazy on. Since I moved recently and, um, I’m just over it, basically, after a long move so just going about things real slowly. Um, hmm, tsk, tsk, tsk, what else? Um, tomorrow I might – I’m trying to get food stamps right now, even though I usually wouldn’t want to do that, but since I don’t have a job now, I think I should do it. Um, so I applied online, but they haven’t gotten back to me, and I’m sure that they kind of ignore those a little bit, so I think I might try to go in there tomorrow and see if my friend Philip wants to go with me, um, because he said that he did before, um, because he was, like, renew his or something, so I might do that tomorrow. Um, no plans, really, other than that. Um, what might be coming up? Um, there’s a BYOB, which is “bring your own beamer,” for projectors at the MCA this month that my friend’s doing, and I’d kind of like to do it, but I don’t know how to get, like – you know, I’m not entirely, and I’m not going to do it, if my name isn’t, like, credited because that would kind of just be a waste of my time. And it needs to, like, be something that would be on my resume if I’m going to do it because other people would have it on theirs or CV, whatever. Um, hmm, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, what else? Um, my cat is off and on, well, she’s like – she’s always on wanting attention, um, because she’s Siamese and crazy, and she wants out all the time, but I don’t really feel comfortable letting her out because there’s, like, a lot of stray cats in the neighborhood, and she’ll probably just get beat up, even though she’s quite large, um, and – not in a fat way. She’s thin, but she’s, like, boy-sized cat. Um, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, um, I think I may organize my computer today a little bit. The desktop looks crazy. And, um, I was bookmarking some stuff last night, and it’d be nice to organize my bookmarks, and they’re not so everywhere, to have, like, separate folders. When I got Comcast it made, like, an Xfinity folder, which is weird. Um, I don’t know why anybody would have that folder, but it’s been saving everything there because I haven’t really been, like, too conscious about it. I just save it. But, uh, what else? Um, maybe I’ll do some laundry. I’ll definitely watch some TV. Maybe I’ll play Xbox because that’s kind of been on my mind, and I haven’t played it in like a month, and I own it so might as well do that now. Um, eventually I would like to start downsizing on all the stuff I have, um, so I can be more mobile in the future, if things don’t work out here, whatever, if I go to school somewhere. I don’t know. Or if I need to move because I might not want to stick in my neighborhood for forever because it’s not the best. But price-wise it’s excellent. Um, let’s see, I got my permit for my car the other day, so that’s good. Um, and I washed my car. Um, went to a good show the other day. It was kind of expensive, but it was good. Um, and it would have been nice if it wasn’t such a late-running show, until like 6:00 a.m., but I was only there until 3:30. Uh, I like how things go late here, like a real city. I’m definitely more of a late-night person than early morning. Um, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, I’ve been meaning to – oh, I know what I need to do. I need to make some videos, which I’ve been meaning to do for like forever. I guess I need to, like, actually work on stuff. Um, I need to be productive. But I guess the job thing’s pretty distracting. That’s one of the problems, and that’s why – one reason why I’d really like to get a job already is because I want to have something regular to, like, get up for and go to.',\n",
       " \"Okay. I'm gonna talk about, I think, transferring to UIC and how excited I am to move to Chicago in January. It’s kind of a big deal because I've been moving around and homeless for a long time. Not like homeless on the street, but transient. So I'm really excited about being able to have a stable place to live with a bunch of people my own age and to have opportunities in Chicago and to intern in sociological science and find opportunities. I'm a little worried about paying for it because I'm going through a dependency appeal and they have to appeal my financial aid – they have to approve my financial aid status and I have to find the money for housing, but the reason I chose UIC and state schools and didn’t apply anywhere private was state schools are pretty cheap, so I think I can afford it. I don’t know; I'm hoping that I can still have my car in summer to work the Morton Aboretum, where I work assisting research on invasive insects and other pest insects, because that is super-fun and I love – well, I don’t love invasive insects, but I think they’re really interesting and I love studying them. I think I'm gonna apply for an internship at the Shedd Aquarium, or a job there because there’s a job there as like an assistant to this Great Lakes project, where they’re going to be going around educating people about ecological problems with the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Michigan. So I wanna apply for that. So I gotta spruce up my resume soon to do that. I hope to get my undergrad – my Bachelor’s in Biological Science and then go on to grad school to study entomology or zoology because I love those things and I love the people who work in those fields and I think it would be a good use of my time in life. I was getting kind of bored of being here so I hope I can leave soon from the study because I want to go and spend the day with my boyfriend because tomorrow’s his birthday and we need to go do something fun somewhere. I don’t really know what else to talk about. He’s pretty cool. I'm a little needy, but he handles it well. I don’t know what he thinks about me being in all these – like I'm always doing little strange things and trying to find ways to get money without working retail jobs, which I've worked a lot of. So I don’t know how he feels about me wandering down here to take part in studies. I really like Hyde Park. Hyde Park’s beautiful and it has a lot of trees and it’s really dark and, you know, they have specialty stores with fancy cheeses, and I think that’s funny. I think all the University of Chicago kids are pretty funny. All the ones I've met have been really sweet and charming. It’s kind of sad, though, because I was homeless and transient throughout high school so I didn’t have any sort of record to apply anywhere with, and the record I did have wasn’t accurate to my actual skills. So it’s kind of sad because I think I could’ve got in to the University of Chicago and really shined here, but I will go somewhere else and I’ll go to UIC and make my name there. I don’t know; I have a lot of friends who live in Hyde Park. Just like cute little couples who live together here and they're really sweet. Tonight I'm probably going to go downtown to participate in Occupy Chicago. I was there last Saturday when they arrested 250; I left right before the arrest and my friend got arrested for occupying a public place after it had gotten closed down. So there’s going to be a repeat of that tonight and I want to be there.\",\n",

I have brown hair. I am Mexican and white. Greenish eyes; really pretty green eyes. I think I'm high on MDME right now, and that’s pretty cool. I think I'm gonna get some more later on. That means I just realized how much I like it. So, I don’t know, today is February something. It’s the year 2012, the year that the world’s going to end. A lot of apocalypse-type stuff. Last night, I was feeling really numb and devoid of feelings and felt like I should go and destroy all my relationships. But then I just listened to a lot of Nikki Minaj instead and felt better. So I think what I should do is major in psychology and then introduce Nikki Minaj therapy onto the world. Since I assume that you have some background in psychology or whatever from whatever fuck this office is or what you guys are studying, don’t steal my idea. Nikki Minaj therapy; it’s all mine. It also goes back into the career thing that I used to tell people that I was going to study. I was like I'm gonna study animal behavior and then move to the West Coast, San Francisco, and introduce a dog shocker healing center and people would charge rich people, like celebrities, huge amounts of money for me to pet their dogs. And I’ll be really high as I pet their dog and they’ll give me a lot of money and I will have a lot of money, which, you know, cash rules everything around me. C.R.E.A.M. Get the money, dollar dollar bill ya’ll. So, yeah, man, you guys should just give me MDME all the time because last time I think you gave me the placebo pill or some boring pill and it was not nearly as fun as it is right now. So, I don’t know, my plans for today are to go with my friend, Mike, Jamie, Neal, and Eli’s apartment on Drexel and 53rd and bother them. They adore me. They're all really hermit people so I come in and I'm all like the energy and they're all like, “Okay.” But I'm trying to put a play night into either apartment so one night per week we all go and read plays. But I never got that photocopy enough so everybody has their own script. There’s some problems because the roommate, Nila, lives there and I have a crush on him, but I have a really monogamous relationship, but he’s really cute and he has a crush on me, too. So that’s a problem; plus he’s my own age, which I have never, ever dated or fooled around with anybody my own age before. So that’s kind of tempting and alluring as well. It’s a problem because my boyfriend is the most amazing person in the world and I adore him. So, yeah, it’s typical teenage girl type stuff. I'm studying biological sciences at UIC. I just transferred here from Joliet Junior College last month. My fellow biology students are kind of disappointing because they don’t care. My lab partner’s cool, though. I kind of am interested in studying neuroscience as well, which is a major at UIC, but biological sciences seems really solid. Plus because I kind of wanna study animal behavior or science writing or entomology, I feel like biology would give me a good background for those things. I really like entomology. I liked entomology since I was a little girl. I would always collect insects and I'm kind of a loner. It’s funny because I was applying for jobs at Joliet Junior College and there’s this lab assistant job, but I went in and I met Dr. Frederick Miller, which is my mentor, and he turned out to be an entomologist, which is extremely exciting for somebody who the love of bugs had kind of faded away as the ravages of adult/adolescence took over. But he gave me a job at the Morton Arboretum as a research assistant in the entomology lab and now it’s awesome. You play around with a lot of dead insect bodies and think about how amazing and beautiful everything is. The smell of alcohol reminds me of the last task I had before being laid off at the Morton Arboretum, which is not really laid off, but it’s just a seasonal job, so I'm laid off until summer.\",\n",
       " \"Okay, so it’s Thursday in May. I'm in Chicago, and I'm really loving Chicago. I just kind of stay in people’s houses and drive around. So, yeah, third and last session. Same old junk. I don’t know what I'm gonna do today; probably finish my book about the formation of consumer culture. And I don’t know, probably smoke some weed, see a movie, go to my friend’s house, which I couldn’t go before because I kissed his roommate and told my boyfriend and then my boyfriend was like, well, it was a big deal. It was very, very dramatic, but eventually after two days we got back together and obviously I can’t go over there when the roommate’s there, but he’s on a road trip today so I can hang out at my friend’s house. That’s cool. My boyfriend, Mario, kind of got in a little spat with them earlier today so I was like, “Fuck Christopher Hitchens.” You know, fuck Christopher Hitchens, whatever. I kind of think a lot of the guys we worship are just – you know worships all these arrogant white dudes. Screw Hitchens; he just gets on my nerves. He’s like a shitty evolutionary psychologist. He’s like, “Women aren’t funny because of evolution.” Fuck you, Christopher Hitchens. What do you know? You don’t. This side is actually more coherent than it’s coming out right now, but there’s not any person in the room so it’s kind of hard to like – I'm kind of lazy and I don’t wanna try. But Saturday I start my job canvasing for the Film Museum, and that will be cool hopefully; although I have to drive a long amount of time to different places in Illinois. That’s fine. Tomorrow’s Friday. I’ll be working at the U.S. English department and they don’t really have anything for me to do, but they're still willing to pay me 20 hours a week if I show up, so I just kind of go there and read blogs and draw pictures of people I find on the Chicago Tribune Police Blotter. So that’s fun. I don’t know; I don’t feel really enthusiastic about anything right now. I think the drug I had was valium, but, yeah, I don’t think it’s because of that; I'm just not feeling really enthusiastic today or anything. I don’t have a lot of friends anymore; I used to have a lot of friends because I lived in a punk anarchist house and there’s always various vagabonds and crazy people coming in and out. And we had this whole little society. That’s when I was 17 and was a runaway. But I got rid of most of those people because they're all pretty shitty and – in regards to me and other girls, they were pretty rapey and trying to score sex from us all the time in like creepy ways. But anyhow, I don’t have a lot of friends that I used to because I kind of figure I probably shouldn’t be making friends with straight men because – or not even straight, but men who are attracted to women – because it always turns out to be really creepy and I don’t fully trust them ever really. But, anyhow, so I don’t have a lot of friends anymore. So I'm trying to cultivate the friendships. Oh, and I've also had this new commitment where I only make friends with people that I like 100 percent, not people that I like 80 or 70 or 90 percent. So that really cuts down my options to like five people. But I've been hanging out with my friend, Susan, who’s a psychologist who works with this non-profit. She’s cool. She’s a graduate of UIC and she just came here a few months ago to live in Chicago and she’s pretty cool. She’s an anarchist lady who’s cool. She’s studying to be a Nurse Practitioner so she’s got her shit together, and we hang out and walk around, smoke weed, and talk.\",\n",
       " 'Okay. I get to talk about whatever I want to talk about. This is fun. First of all, I’m really enjoying this study and this drug. It’s so – I love this stuff. I’m sad that I’m coming down a little bit. I mean I can feel myself coming down a little bit. What a way to spend a Saturday morning. I’ve been thinking about Jeff a lot but most – not even about Jeff, but I’ve been thinking about what the meaning of life is and not just today, but always. But I guess it’s sort of come to a head in the last couple of weeks. And what makes our lives worth living? And what brings meaning to our lives? And why we’re even here? And is it cheesy? And specifically, to me, like what makes my life worthwhile? Not because it’s been validated by anybody else – a boyfriend, friends, blah, blah, blah because that’s all happened. But I was looking in the mirror a couple nights ago. And I was like what is it, why is my life worthwhile? What is it that I do? What is it that brings value to my existence? And then it’s so obvious. The only thing – I wrote it down in my book. The love that we bring to anyone and everything we do and anyone else is all there is. You don’t have to be – even if you were famous, at the end of the day – or rich or whatever – it would just be about the love that you’re bringing to anybody. I mean that’s all that counts. That’s all there is. So the more love that you can bring, that’s what gives my life meaning, I guess, worthwhile meaning. And that’s in every moment. How can you bring more love to the situation? How can you appreciate the unfolding? And how can you appreciate other spirits the way that they are? How can you appreciate yourself in relation to those things? I really think that’s what it’s all about. And sometimes I feel like I have to do things to make my life worthwhile, like my whole life. I’m like, oh, I’m not this, or I’m not that, or I don’t have this career. I don’t do this. And it doesn’t fucking matter. Nothing matters. You can have or do or be anything you want. But most important is to be loving in every moment, all the time, as much as you can. And everything else is just a distraction – and a fun distraction, for sure. But if you get too attached to the distractions, they end up owning you, and that’s no good either. I don’t know. I’m thinking about Jeff and the future. I think for a minute there when I was doing the survey, I just thought about the future, and I felt so overwhelmed. It’s like whoa. What is the rest of my life going to be like? What is happening? Where to go next, you know? You grow up, and it’s always school, then college, then this, then job, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I just started thinking to myself like, wow, what is the next thing to do? What is the next project? What’s the next challenge? And what if I don’t find it? What if it’s not there? What if I can’t move to New York? What if I can’t sustain myself? What if I – what if, what if, what if, you know? All of these what ifs. But then there’s always love to catch you. And there’s a way to make things happen. And they will happen. And everybody is here, connecting and working together. And nobody knows what the fuck the future’s going to bring. Nobody does. But we’re all just doing our best. And that’s really beautiful. And that’s really beautiful that nobody knows what the future’s going to bring. Nobody does. Oh, I feel like I’m being really not annoying, but – oh, there’s Saline.',\n",
       " 'It feels more comfortable to hold it because it makes feel like maybe I’m on stage. I don’t know. There’s something about holding it that makes it feel more official, like we’re on a show. Let’s see. What do I want to talk about? I guess I’ll talk about how I’m feeling. Oh, I can’t – I don’t remember what I talked about the last time I did this. I wish I could remember. I’d love to hear that tape. Let’s see. How am I feeling? I’m feeling like – in my head I’m feeling super – clear, capable. I feel like I’m able to do anything. Like people could ask me something, and I’d be like, sure, I’ll take care of that. I’ll take care of that. I’ll take care of that. I’ll take care of that. Although, I guess if you’re listening to this tape, you’d probably be a little wary of having me take care of stuff. Actually, maybe not, though. I don’t know. I feel like I’m a little fidgety, but it’s not in a bad way. It’s just like, oh, moving around. I’m not restless, like I’m not anxious to get up and do anything. Anyway, what else do I want to talk about? Let’s see. I’m moving to New York next week. And I guess I’m a little nervous about it. I think it’s going to be fine, though. I’m pretty sure it’s going to be fine. It is going to be fine. I mean, what is the worst that can happen? You move to New York. If I run out of money, I’ll just get a job waiting tables. I can get a job doing whatever. It’s just like, och, I don’t necessarily – I guess the fear is that I’m going to have to do something that isn’t going to be fun or that I don’t want to do. But you can make anything fun. Really, you can make anything fun. And I mean this – I have fun no matter what. This study is fun. It doesn’t have to be fun, but it is. And I think I’d make it fun even if I wasn’t on the little pills. What else do I want to talk about? What to talk about? What to talk about? I wish I had my guitar. I would sing a song for you guys. I love singing. I was telling Saline that – Salina, excuse me – I keep calling her Saline, but her name’s Salina. I keep telling her – or I told her earlier – that more people need to sing than actually sing. And we’re all so scared of it. Well, not me. I’m not scared of it anymore. But a lot of people are scared of singing. But they shouldn’t be. It’s so – I mean, it’s important to use your voice. Sorry, I got to think about some other stuff to say. Let’s see. What do I want to talk about? Okay. Oh, there’s a little timer on here – an hour and ten seconds – I mean a minute and ten seconds. You know, I think it would be easier to do this, if there was some type of prompt, like, oh, talk about this, or talk about that, or if you knew the person you were talking to. It’s hard to just talk when you don’t know who you’re talking to, or what they’d be interested in or maybe what they want to hear. But then that begs the questions – are we just saying what other people want to hear? But, no. I think we choose to divulge certain things about ourselves based on what other people give us signals that they’re interested in by way of their dress or their mannerisms or those little peripheral things that – like how they hold a pen or something or like these non-verbal cues. So when there’s no non-verbal cues, it’s hard to know what to talk about because you don’t really know what’s going to be interesting, what the point is, what to say. I think Salina is going to come back in any second, but I hope this was entertaining for you. Or I hope it wasn’t too boring. Oh, and that thing that I wrote the last time I was in a study – five days ago, I realized – oh, it’s over. I’ll tell you next time.',\n",
       " 'Alright, this is my very last talking session. Hmm. I didn’t bring my guitar. I just remember I was gonna sing a song, but I didn’t, but I guess you’re more interested in the psychological stuff anyway. I am pretty sure I didn’t get anything in the little blue pill today, which is fine. I have a lot of stuff to do before I go out to dinner with my brother and his fiancé and her fiancé’s family. And then get on a plane tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. for New York, so it’s probably good I didn’t get anything in the little blue pill. Or if I did get anything I’m not feeling it. I said goodbye to my mom this morning. My mom and dad just got divorced, finalized their divorce a year ago, and I’ve been staying with her and it’s been sort of weird. I’m sorry, it hasn’t been weird between us, but I’ve been staying with her for the past couple months, and she was really sad to see me go. I wonder – it’s interesting like I feel like while I was home all she could do was lament the fact that my brothers didn’t call her and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I’m like okay mom but I’m right here and now I’m leaving and now she’s getting all sad. And like well maybe you should have appreciated me while I was home, but I don’t really mean – I mean – I don’t know I mean that a little bit, but not too much. I love my mom and she’s great. I’ve been feeling a little sad lately though with her. I think I’m like picking up some of her emotions. I don’t know. I think it’ll be good for me to get away from her. Not get away from her I love her but yeah be on my own. I never thought I’d live with my mom at this age even just for a couple months, but I think it’s good that I got some time to just sort of relax and pull my stuff together since coming back from California. And it was good to sort of hash out these family issues that I have, but I think my mood will improve when I’m not actively around her. She can be a bit of a – I don’t know I think I feel a sense of expectation when I’m around her that I don’t feel normally, and so I feel more freedom when I’m with her, which is everything I guess for me at least. Gosh, I feel like this is boring, I’m sorry. I wonder what I could say that would be interesting. I want to say something interesting. What is interesting? Let’s see, I can’t remember what I talked about the other times. I don’t want to just re-say interesting things that I said. Oh, I know, I’ll tell a joke. What do you get when you add 50 deer and 50 cows? Ready? What do you get when you add 50 deer and 50 cows? A hundred thousand bucks. Isn’t that a good one? Okay. Let me think. Do I know another joke? Not anyone that – well, there’s an old one which you probably know because you’re psychologists or something. But I’ll tell you anyway. No, this one’s dumb. Okay, I’ll just tell you anyway. What did the Buddhist say to the hotdog vendor? What did he say? Blah, blah, blah. Make me one with everything. I bet you already heard that one. That one’s kind of old. On Thursday, my friend’s friend’s band is playing at the Empty Bottle. They’re called Sonoi S-o-n-o-i and I’m not sure if I’m pronouncing know them they’re my friend’s friend’s band. But I wish I could go see the show, but I’m leaving tomorrow and I can’t see them on Thursday. That’s a bummer. Let’s see what else. I’m excited to move to New York. I’m a little nervous about getting employed, but I think I’ll – I’m not nervous about finding a job because I know I could find a job. I’m just worried about finding a fun job that is gonna pay me the amount of money that I want to get. I would rather – I guess I would rather have a fun job than a boring job that pays me a lot. But ideally I would get a fun job that also pays a lot of money because money is nice. I mean I’d like to live in a nice apartment, and I’d like to go shopping at the Farmer’s Market every weekend, and I’d like to you know go to the five weddings that I’m supposed to go to this summer. And I’d like to buy cute designer clothes, and I’d like to get a new bike and ride my bike around the streets. And I know that that sounds shallow, but I think that would be fun, and I like going to brunch, and I like leaving really generous tips. I was a waitress for a long time and I like doing that. And I mean it takes money to do all that. It does and there’s nothing wrong with that. So I would like – but – but I mean not at the expense of doing a job that I don’t feel is morally right. Well, there’s Selena. It’s been nice talking to you. Thank you. Bye. #1293_ser244.s1.monolog#Charles# All right, so I’m not really sure what to talk about except the fact that I’m really sleepy and hungry. Um, there’s a lot of dust and dirt under the sofa. Um, this weekend promises to be pretty hot outside and it’s kinda unsettling since I’m not really used to really, really hot weather. Um, I guess I’m gonna have to stay indoors where it’s a little cooler. I really do hope to get a full time job pretty soon because I don’t think I can have all this free time and not go crazy in this city. I mean, because there’s plenty of stuff to do, but I don’t know. It’s not really worth it if I’m not making any money and I’m just lazy around. Hm, most of the time I’m just wondering what it is I’m gonna end up doing because I’m 25 and I still don’t know what it is I wanna do or where it is I wanna go. But, I’m usually like that – I’m usually worrying about what the hell it is I’m doing all the time. I don’t know, I guess I just figure that I’ll figure it out sooner or later; just you know let things fall into place. I do think it was a good idea to uh move out here to Chicago. I don’t think I should have stayed in Puerto Rico much longer. I was going kinda crazy. Everybody there knows each other, everybody does the same stuff every single weekend over and over again and no one really seams invested in each other at all. So, I don’t know. Maybe that’s just how I feel. I don’t know. Maybe I just got bored; I probably did. I do get bored pretty easily. I don’t know, we’ll see how that works out and we’ll see how my dog starts to like the city because so far he likes going outside but he hates everybody that he encounters, dogs, neighbors, everybody. Anybody that makes noise outside the apartment he hates them. I’m not exactly sure why that is. I guess it’s just a new place for him and that’s how he’s dealing with it. I need to get out and meet people because I am – I do not know anybody. I just need to take a nap or eat something, ugh. I really like the rothco on the wall. I looks pretty cool. I used to have a rothco.',\n",
       " 'Hm, what to talk about? Um, so I guess I could talk about my most recent upset. So, yesterday I found out that a friend of mine that I’ve know since I was about in seventh grade um she was – she lives in New York and then she moved to Mexico for some time and then she decided to move to Puerto Rico, which was were I was a couple of months ago, and so I offered her my apartment um because I was leaving and you know I wasn’t gonna be able to manage getting rid of everything. So, I basically told her to keep some of the stuff, like the plates and a lot of the kitchen ware and some of the chairs and stuff like that that I wasn’t gonna be using just to make it easier for her from her um transition from Mexico over to Puerto Rico and well – uh, yeah so basically uh she kept a lot of the stuff and so she was there until recently, but um we like never had reached an agreement as to you know what was gonna happen to the furniture after – if she decided to leave or whatever. So, she just kind of assumed that she could just take the furniture with her and I just found out yesterday that she moved into another apartment, of course a cheaper apartment or whatever, and she took most of the furniture and you know we hadn’t come to an agreement where she could keep the furniture, but you know since it was my furniture to begin with and my apartment stuff I thought she was gonna – kinda just gonna let me know what she was doing with it if she ever left and she apparently didn’t. Um, I found out from my – from the landlady from my apartment because she wasn’t answering my calls or my emails or anything because I was gonna schedule my grandma to go pick up all the stuff so that she could either like sell it off or give it to donations or whatever and so apparently she took the furniture to her new apartment and she didn’t tell me anything and she was just kinda expecting me to be okay with that. And um, I found out and I kinda told my mom about it – like I told her the situation because I was at work and I was really upset because I had no – you know, I have no way of getting in touch with her because she’s always ignoring my calls and emails. Um, and of course I’m not gonna go down to Puerto Rico to seek her out, you know, about the furniture, so I told my mom about it and kinda like asked her what she thinks I should do about that specific situation because I don’t think it’s fair. A lot of that furniture was kind of expensive, so um I basically just told her and my mom got really upset. She’s very like over protective and she got really upset and um she was talking about um talking to a lawyer and getting someone down there in Puerto Rico to seek her out and blah, blah, blah. And like, I got really upset and got really frustrated and you know I think it kind of bothered me the most mostly because she’s just – you know, she’s been a friend of mine for so long and I really care for her a lot and then, you know, when I finally contacted her, you know, she kind of put up a front like, oh you shouldn’t give me an attitude because you left a lot of stuff undone and you left me with a lot of stuff in your apartment and I had to manage all that stuff and I’m moving by myself and you know. And you know, I get it, but at the same time it’s like you shouldn’t be so – you know, inconsiderate with other people’s belongings and like if I was so generous you should, you know, appreciate it and be a little more careful with other people’s stuff. You know, I didn’t necessarily leave it to her possession; I left it so she could use during the transition. I guess it just wasn’t very clear or whatever, but yeah. I don’t like really think it was cool or how she reacted or how she dealt with it, so yeah I’m kinda frustrated with that at the moment and like being over here in Chicago and like I don’t really have any friends over here and then the ones back home are acting like this is like, ugh. I really – it really sucks as you get older and people –',\n",
       " 'Okay, so um I’m very anxious about leaving Chicago. That’s probably one of the things that I’ve had most on my mind the um last couple of days. I am moving from a big city to a tiny town in Montana and I’ve been debating with myself whether it was the right thing to do or not, but you know, I don’t know. I guess there isn’t one right or wrong thing to do, but I haven’t been feeling that great Chicago and it’s not even because of the city because the city’s fantastic. It’s just my living situation has been absolutely challenging. I had no idea living with my brother was gonna be so difficult. Um, it’s really upsetting to have to realize that you know there are certain family members that you just can’t live with and it sucks because if you can’t live with your family who can you live with, right? Just complete strangers? That’s sucks. So, it think I’ve kinda come to realization that I have to live by myself, which isn’t terrible because I really do like solitude and I do like living by myself, but I don’t know. It’s kind of disappointing either way. Um, uh I don’t know. Um, I’m sure Montana’s gonna be fine and I’m just worried that I’m gonna feel this way no matter where I go because what if it’s not – what if it wasn’t something necessarily having to do with, you know, my brother? What if it had to do with me and what if it’s just me and I have issues you know living with other people? What if I just can’t live with other people, you know? Because even when I lived with my boyfriend and we lived together for about two years you would think that someone that you love so much you’d be able to like make it a fun time, but I got tired of it, I got bored and then I started having an affair, which was, you know, it was ridiculous. But, I don’t know, maybe it’s just I need to learn to live with other people. Maybe that’s my thing. A lot of people need to learn to live by themselves. Some people just can’t deal with solitude, but I’m just the total opposite. I love living by myself. I have gotten many complaints from my friends and family that I’m too shut off and that I need to, you know, go out more, hang out more with people. But, I don’t know, I guess that’s not the kind of stuff I care about or that I’m interested in at all. Um, yeah Montana scares the shit out of me just because it’s a tiny city. I’m gonna be living with my sister whom I haven’t lived with in years. I haven’t lived with her since she was in med school. That was like before 2003. So, that’s kind of nerve racking. Everybody changes and stuff and I know I’ve changed a lot and I wonder if she’s going to, you know, be accepting of the person I’ve turned into because I’m obviously not the same 15 year old that she used to know. I um really excited about taking care of my nephew, her son. Um, but at the same time I’m really nervous because I’m not necessarily good with kids and I’m scared that, you know, I might not be the best Aunt that I can be just because that’s what I think kids need. I at least felt very deprived of, you know, Aunts and cousins because my family wasn’t big on sharing time with people like that in my family. We were very just close knit, us, my mom, my dad, my brother, my sisters and that’s it.',\n",
       " 'So, I don’t know I guess I’ll introduce myself. My name is Melissa. I am currently 19 years old. I am a student at Indiana University and I’m studying at Pearl Merchandising and working at Berry Berry Yoghurt Shop at DePaul University, around the DePaul University area. I like to talk about my work, I recently got hired about two weeks ago and the boss is nice to an extent really because she gets a little impatient sometimes and I feel like – well, she’s seven months pregnant and I feel like that has something to do with it maybe and sometimes she gets a little impatient with me but overall it’s a really easy job and sometimes it’s really stressful because it’s basically one person working at a time. You have to cut up fruit. You have to make sure everything’s okay and make the shop look okay and all the while serving customers and sometimes it’s really stressful because it – sometimes the line full of customers that stretches out the door and it’s like I’m doing a one person thing. I don’t wanna make anyone upset and sometimes it’s a little hard to because sometimes you mess up. Well recently I had a really bad experience working-wise because I worked at a hooker bar like three blocks away from my house and it really, they really swindled me out of my way just because they really didn’t sign anything. They didn’t have any formal documents they just said, “You’re just gonna be paid from tipped wages.” And there was no payroll. There was nothing like that and my gut feeling told me, get out of here, get out of here, it’s just gonna be a waste. But for some reason I stayed with my boyfriend. He stayed by my side and I was a waitress that night and it was pretty busy that night and I don’t know. I just felt really used. I was on a date with my boyfriend because we wanted to smoke some hooka and so before I even started, even took a, I didn’t even take any hooka, they just put me to work and I’m like, okay, that’s a little sketchy but okay. And so I did that. I worked all night and what pissed me off most was that they said that I would earn a minimum of $50.00 and work till 2:00 AM. At 2:30 I was like, I need to go. It’s so late. You promised me at 2:00 I can leave. I only made $35.00 that night but I went back because I talked to my father because they’re not supposed to do that first of all, they’re supposed to pay you $4.80 an hour plus tipped wages in Illinois and that’s referring to a restaurant like a waitress and when I said that to my boss, so to say he was like, “No, we pay you in tipped wages.” Like, “No I’m not gonna give you a receipt for your –” It was so sketchy. It was just so sketchy and so I went back there and I talked to the manager. I talked to my boss in the kitchen and the waiter, I don’t know, I was supposed to sign. I was supposed to keep the signed receipt for a credit card but no one taught me anything. I feel stupid saying this but I’ve never really worked a formal register before and so for them to just throw me out there like that really pissed me off, really, really pissed me off because I felt like I was being taken advantage of. I went back there and even though I got – I was paid $55.00 that wasn’t worth six hours of basically doing all the work for the waiters because there was this one other waitress working with me that night and she was like, “Hey, my name is Rose. Blah blah blah I’m gonna have you man the floor more because I’m a little tired tonight.” And I was like, really? The entire night she was just dancing on the dance floor because they had live singers and a belly dancer, so she was just dancing on the dance floor and I was like, really? Really? Come on now. And so I felt swindled out of my cash, my wages because in reality I should have been paid about $110.00 because that was based on tips that I had for tables and the $4.80 per hour in Illinois. So, yeah, I mean –',\n",
       " 'I’m hungry. My throat kind of hurts. I would really like some IHOP chocolate chip pancakes. I love breakfast food. A lot of food’s on my mind right now but breakfast food mainly. I also wanna take my boyfriend on a date. I’m deciding where because just to celebrate how long I’ve been at my current job, which is my first job and I’m 19. I don’t know where to take him because I would really like – because he’s from this small farm town in Indiana so I would love for him to experience a really nice restaurant in Chicago because it’s Chicago. It’s a nice city. I love this city and I’m just wondering what place I should go because I really, really, like. It’s so good for lunch. That would be amazing or say – he likes Italian food a lot but I really wanna find a good Italian restaurant because I know a little Italian in Everson that my ex-boyfriend took me to but it’s okay. It’s mediocre Italian food and it’s definitely not worth $30.00 a plate. I don’t know. I really wanna do something special for him because this past weekend we kind of got into a fight because of my parents putting a lot of stress on me and me kind of arguing with them being stubborn and I rubbed that anger off on him, like I take it out on him and I really hate that because he’s awesome. He really doesn’t deserve that, especially since he’s just staying over the summer and just getting to know my family. I’m so grateful that he’s here too because honestly he is my best friend. He is someone that won’t ruin my trust because I had a best friend, like I said had, it’s crazy that I say that now because I really trusted this girl, met her in college this first year. We were supposed to be roommates then she basically got really drunk one night and she got caught by her RA’s and I was there and I took her. I went to the hospital with her and she – yeah I stayed up with her all night and I was caring for her and basically she screws over my boyfriend with rent money in regards to that. She didn’t pay any of that and she screwed him over with that. She gets kicked out of school for the next semester because of low grades and she’s basically not living with me next year which means that I have to deal with a legally binding contract for my apartment back at college and she’s really not doing it, anything. She’s just ignoring it. She thinks if she ignores things then it’ll go away but it just makes things so much more worse. I just can’t believe she’d do that to me because I’ve never done anything wrong. The stupidest things and I know it’s stupid to say, something like this but I let her borrow my clothes all the time and I’m really possessive of my clothes because I don’t – I’ve had people not bring back my clothes or I never see my clothes again because I forget that people have them and I would always let her borrow my clothes no matter what. And another thing that I would hate, I would hate about doing that is that she had body odor problems and she would always, always, bring my clothes smelling really nasty but I wouldn’t care because I really cared about her and I just can’t believe that she would do something like that to me in regards of our apartment. She basically just left me saying – she just left me, expecting me to pay $875.00 by myself a month. I’m a student. I’m a out of state student. No, I can’t do that. That’s not affordable whatsoever but I mean like, she just continues to ignore me. I’ve at least sent her four messages in regards to an ad to placing an ad about our apartment and she has not responded. She has ignored me. It’s frustrating because someone you cared about so much just leaves and hurts you like that. It’s really painful. It’s painful because I really thought I found someone that could just bond with, be cool with but again she is just –',\n",
       " 'This feels really weird, I feel like kind of disassociated honestly like my jaw is kind of tense and at first I honestly thought like oh it’s just gonna be placebo because I really didn’t feel anything the first half hour. Then it literally hit me like a truck. I was like, woah, is this happening? Because I was just watching Billy Madison and everything kind of started getting wavy and dizzy and I was like, woah, can I move my muscles? And I had trouble moving them and my jaw is still tense. My hands and feet are kind of clammy. That’s when I knew something was happening because my hands and feet were getting clammy. That doesn’t happen so yeah. Later today, I’m going to go see my friend who moved to Mexico to study in university and she’s here for the summer and I can’t wait to see her and later I’m going to see my boyfriend as well. I want to go to Sprinkles Cupcakes downtown with him because me and him have like this tradition going on almost every week and we always go on Twitter because we get two free cupcakes if we say like a certain pass, like a word, and you get a free cupcake if you’re the first of 50 people and then we’d buy more cupcakes because they’re really, really good. One last week, I believe, we tried the mocha, mocha with it’s like a buttermilk bread with mocha frosting on it with sprinkles. It was so good and carrot cake and banana. Banana cake has to be my favorite, kind of more so bland desert. It’s really good. Especially in a cupcake, that was really, really good. I’m kind of excited to leave Chicago but at the same time I’m not because there’s so many responsibilities that I have to take care of before I even arrive in my college town, like selling my apartment, hopefully that’ll happen by today or tomorrow because I have been talking to two girls who want my apartment, getting financial things set and straight and I can’t wait until the end of August so all this will be sorted out because it’s kind of stressing. It’s stressing for sure and like ordering books and you know just keeping up with, keeping on a study schedule and stuff like that it’s difficult but I know I can do it this year, definitely. I feel like this year is gonna be my year to really grow up so to say, like last year was definitely a taste of it and I definitely saw myself grow up but I think this year is gonna really change me. I don’t know why but I have a feeling and it’s a good one. I can’t wait to go home. I just wanna go home and rest because I’m kind of tired. It sucks that I’ve been canceling so much because my work schedule’s really hectic and my boss only gives it to me at the end of the week and sometimes I work 10 hour shifts and sometimes I work 8 hour shifts and it really does suck but I’m saving up money for my rent so I feel like it is definitely well earned. I’m living with my boyfriend this year. I’m very excited. We’re a good couple. We’re just a good couple. He is my best friend and I don’t know, we match so so well. Everything’s been going so smoothly between me and him and I couldn’t ask for more in a significant other. He’s so supportive and loving and funny. I love how funny he is. He’s just so outgoing. It’s nice definitely. He really honestly, he has to be the best boyfriend I’ve ever had. Sounds cliché but really. The weird thing is that my sister’s in here as well because she’s a volunteer for OC because she’s going to medical school and she needs clinical hours. I hope she becomes really successful because it’s my sister. I love her dearly although sometimes we get into stupid arguments or stupid petty things. I love her dearly and I wish only the best for her because she’s such a bright person and it’s just weird that she’s here as well. It’s weird that she graduated because honestly I feel like both of us went to college and blah blah blah and I felt like it should be that way but it’s weird that she’s not going back to college. She’s staying here and then she’s taking the AVCAT in September so I’m really excited for her. My hands still feel clammy. It’s really –',\n",
       " 'This is a funny premise. Body high. I just wanna move around. I really hate the jaw clenching and cold hands. Repeating patterns, I guess, I’ll make some patterns. I haven’t felt like this since that burning man which is bringing back a lot of memories of burning man, splendid. Lots of ecstasy, ever since then I’ve started clenching my jaw it’s a tension thing. It sucks. It’s a really negative effect. My breath also feels different. And five minutes.',\n",
       " 'Like most days I feel I should just talk about how I feel physically. For some reason, well definitely numb, feeling pretty numb but it’s interesting because I’m really only feeling that numb above my right knee which is really interesting. Why, why, why there? Yeah, very relaxed. I like this feeling much better than the one previous. Definitely a pain killer. Last time I had pain killers, I had surgery on my left ankle. I don’t love them though, does make you feel very nauseous but I can see why people will take it. Which I really like feeling in my body though, the fact that the skin just above my right knee feels so not there like I’ve had a local anesthetic or something. It’s kind of a nice feeling though. My jaw’s not clenching. That’s a plus. I hate that feeling. How am I gonna do this trip? Also feeling very loving.',\n",
       " 'Monolog task. I don’t feel high at all which is probably a good thing because residual effects usually suck and I have a lot to do. I have a lot to do. Moving is very expensive unfortunately so it’s probably best. I don’t know if I overdosed on something or maybe I just got placebo. Regardless, I still wanna take a nap. I haven’t fallen asleep. I’m a little anxious about this trip honestly. Three minutes. Four minutes. Five minutes.',\n",
       " 'Um, I really don’t know what to say. There’s not much I wanna talk about right now, so uh yeah. I hope I don’t get this drug again. It’s kinda weird. I feel weird. Yeah, I’m not sleep. Uh, okay. I have nothing really to talk about, but I’m supposed to talk every few minutes or every few seconds or whatever. I’m really curious as to what I just took though. This is definitely not something I’ve taken before. I haven’t taken much, but it’s definitely – well, maybe it could be weed or uh, ecstasy. Those are the only two that I’ve taken, but definitely didn’t feel like this. This felt like a real drug, like it’s – uh, I was definitely super high for a minute. I hope that I can do everything that I need to do today; I have a lot to do this week in general. Tomorrow’s my birthday by the way. So, I have to get prepared for that. This is finals week for me in school. One of the hardest classes I’ve ever taken, anatomy – level two anatomy. The first one I got an A, this one I’m barely getting a C. I didn’t really study for anything, but you know usually I don’t have to study for tests. I kinda – something I’m good at, but um this semester I kind slacked off a little. Um, but yeah I need to study for my test, I have to go work out today. I have to because I took a physic last at my college and the grade depends on how many visits, so I have to get my visits in. Hopefully this drugs wears off in time for me to do that and then I’m going to sleep for a long, long time.',\n",
       " 'Hello. Um, don’t really have too much to talk about, as usual. Not the most talkative person in general. But, um I feel good. I think I’m definitely not high or on any type of drug right now. I think that was a placebo because I feel perfectly fine, which is great actually. I think I need to get back to writing. I always feel more productive and more fulfilled when I’m expressing myself creatively. I haven’t been doing that lately. So, I feel kinda blah. I just don’t have the inspiration really at this moment. I’m happy that I’m out of school. I had a douche bag teacher this semester. Tried to sabotage me. My grade, like literally sabotage. I have never encountered such things before in my educational experience, but I guess there’s always gotta be an a-hole somewhere. Still have my 3.9 GPA though, so happy about that.',\n",
       " 'Well, um I’m glad that I didn’t get what I got the first time today, I don’t think at least. It might have been a lower dosage or something like that, but I feel pretty good. Um, I actually came in here really nervous because I didn’t know what I was gonna get and uh I’m pretty – I’m pretty happy about how I’m feeling right now, so I appreciate that. I know it’s random, but um I’m very happy that I didn’t get something that was gonna make me feel like crap because that’s what the first one did. I don’t know what that was, but uh obviously I’m traumatized by it. I never ever wanna feel like that again. Uh, yeah so. Today was a good day. You guys should get some newer movies. That would be nice, but uh the selection isn’t too bad I guess. Don’t really have too much else to say, but I think I’m supposed to talk like very few minutes or something. The stuff did make my mouth dry though, like really dry. It made my stomach kinda clinch up a little. I’m not sure why, but other than that it wasn’t too bad. I don’t see how people do hard-core drugs. I mean, I really – I can’t see myself doing anything worse than what I’ve taken here. I’m like feeling out of control and like my brain isn’t functioning properly. I value my brain, my intelligence. If you don’t have that, you don’t really have much. So, yeah drugs are not for me, not hard drugs. Maybe not any, I don’t know.',\n",
       " 'Alright, well today is Monday, July 30, 2012. I’m just sitting here at a study session. It takes about an hour and fifteen, hour and five minutes to get here which kind of sucks, especially if you’re on a train. I’m pretty bored most of the time at home because I don’t have a job this summer which is also not good because I have to go back to school and pay for some of my school loans and books and art supplies. This weekend, my mom and her boyfriend came up to visit me and my boyfriend Andrew, it was fun I got to see some things that I haven’t seen while being in Chicago, tourist attractions like Navy Pier. My mom was really excited about it but for me I don’t like really being around people that well, kind of more into myself and do whatever I want but being that I had to I guess tour my mom around and her boyfriend just being with them for long periods of time, I really got sick of it. I kind of just wanted them to leave as soon as possible or during the day they’d be there for around five hours so and then by the time I was tired of walking them around the neighborhood or going somewhere and I just wanted to sleep and it’s kind of funny because she says, “Oh, the old people are wearing the young people out.” And it’s true because I don’t really do that much during the day so when I do do a lot, I get very tired so I felt that was kind of funny. She actually went to the Wicker Park Fest this weekend after me and my boyfriend got too tired I don’t wanna do anything but apparently there was a lot of people my age getting really drunk and they were selling beer for $5.00 a bottle. I think at Wicker Park but someone that lived really close by was selling cans for $2.00 and they would, if someone wanted a beer they’d put $2.00 in this bucket and then the guys in the window in their apartment would wind up the bucket with a string and take the $2.00 and put a can of beer in the bucket and put the string back down to the ground so people could get a buck, so they could get their beer, that was kind of funny. She said she got entertainment out of that. I think that would be pretty funny and I think that’s a pretty good idea. My mom’s boyfriend, Joe, he’s really nice. I’m also very glad they’re together. They broke up once because my mom went to Greece with my sister and her ex and my sister and her ex-boyfriend and my mom found this Greek guy and all of her life she’s wanted to date a Greek guy because she is Greek and that’s what all the Greek Orthodox people want is their kids usually themselves want to marry a Greek man or be dating a Greek man. For me it doesn’t really matter, my sister used to think like that but now I think she got a little bit away from it. My brother, he doesn’t care, he’s actually gay. So he’s not really, he’s not really into the Greek scene but after that my mom got back together again with Joe and they are very happy. They go out with their friends every weekend. They all go to a bar, go to a concert in the park. They actually do more activities than me because they have more friends, I’ve only been here for the summer so I don’t really know many people. That’s a little bit about them.',\n",
       " 'So, this weekend was supposed to be my birthday weekend because my birthday’s gonna be August 13th. That’s when I go back to school and my boyfriend’s not gonna be there. Actually, I’m gonna be with a bunch of CA’s and RA’s and that’s really not gonna be that fun so he gave me my birthday presents yesterday. I wasn’t completely surprised and I wasn’t ecstatic about them but I think they were nice, very nice gestures. He got me I think 16 gigabytes of RAM for my computer, which I didn’t need because when I edit a lot of photos I need that so it’ll speed up my computer. So I put those in which is, I think it was a nice present because it was something I needed but I didn’t feel like buying. He bought me Aveda hair product. I’ve been talking about it a lot after I have got my haircut at a salon so surprisingly I used it last night and it’s not as good as I thought I was gonna be. When I got out of the salon, my hair smelled amazing and I was like, I want my hair to smell like this all the time. So he got me the shampoo, conditioner, and lotion which was nice. I probably wouldn’t have bought that either. I would’ve just got the moose probably but he wanted me to have it. It’s probably gonna be like my dessert shampoo and conditioner because it’s pretty expensive. And my third present is that he made me a website and I think it’s www.CarryMorgan.com so he paid for my hosting for two years and now I can have my own site where I can put my pictures and if I need to have, ask someone with my resume they can see that I am, I guess stable or more accomplished so that was a nice gift, too. I obviously didn’t expect that at all. Me and Andrew also have a website together, Gray Lines Studio. We did photography for one wedding together which was really really fun but our website’s up but it’s not complete, just like my new website. I think Gray Lines Studio is an awesome name, I think we both like the color gray a lot, gray and black, probably our favorite colors but I keep thinking about lately though is getting a new tattoo because I feel that tattoo’s express what I’m feeling, or not what I’m feeling but it’s like almost having, it’s weird to say, like a gang sign and like you can put up your own gang sign of a tattoo or whatever you want but it’s very individual and other people with tattoo’s tend to like maybe other people with tattoo’s so you can always maybe make friends that way or know who you wanna hang out with which this summer I didn’t’ really find any – we didn’t really find any friends, I don’t really know how to make friends. It’s weird because I’ve been in school and that’s normally how I meet people but when I don’t have a job and I’m not in school here, how do you meet people? It’s the same with my boyfriend. He got a job but everyone that he works with is old and have kids so it was hard for us to meet anyone. I guess that’s a good reason why he’s going to grad school, so he can meet people. My brother might come visit me when I go back to LA again. I hope he does because I haven’t seen him in a long time and he goes to school in Virginia. He goes to school for musical stuff. I don’t know.',\n",
       " 'Well, I feel pretty tired right now, kind of just wanna go to sleep. My new down comforter is actually alternative down which is I was a little disappointed because I thought it was real, no down but then after I brought it back home, I realized it wasn’t but it still feels pretty real and I used it last night and it works and it wasn’t too hot and it wasn’t too cold but it’s a full slash queen size so it’s pretty big, nice to wrap around your body. Friday morning, I’m gonna be going back to Pennsylvania. I don’t really wanna do that drive. I don’t really wanna pack tonight. I have a lot of things to do when I get back to school. I’m gonna be getting back late and then have to unpack everything. I have other stuff I left at school in another room that I have to take out of that room and put it into my room. I have to paint and then Saturday morning, we’re going, I guess they’re taking us for training, for CA training to Presque Isle and Eerie and we’re gonna be there all day which seems like it would be nice but really I’d rather just stay on campus and be able to go back to my room whenever I want. So, that’ll be kind of annoying and since my boyfriend Andrew will be taking me back, he has car inspection appointment on Saturday morning so he’s driving back to his house early in the morning and then he’s coming back to my dorm when I get back from Presque Isle and doing whatever and then he’ll probably help me organize my room and then he’ll most likely leave Sunday morning. I have training Monday or training Sunday pretty much all day and then on Monday’s my birthday. I have a little bit of training and then all the RA’s moving so I have to be prepared for them to come. The only reason I’m excited to be a CA is because I get a huge room, bedroom, living room and bathroom for free and a free mail plan so I guess I can’t really complain. It took a lot off my intuition this semester, well this year. I don’t know what I’m gonna do tonight, probably just pack, watch a few episodes of Breaking Bad, I think. I don’t know if I have to do anymore shopping before I go back to school. I know I have to round to Home Depot to return something. I feel like I’m gonna forget a lot of things at the apartment just because all my stuff’s everywhere, inside of other boxes or where they should be if I were to live there but obviously I’m not living there so I need to find everything that’s mine and take it back with me because I’ll probably need it. I already started. I packed two boxes already of all little things, two mugs and this lamp that I made so something’s already packed.',\n",
       " \"So this is Samantha. I’m chillin' out right now at the research center, and feeling very, uh, chill. Um, I don't really feel stimulated or anything. I feel, like, kinda tired and stuff. I've had, um, a busy week, but at the same time I also haven't been very active. Like, I've just gone to school, and sat down, you know, for long periods of time, and then went to work and sat down. So even though, like, I was booked minute to minute on my schedule, I really haven't had a chance to be too active. Um, which kind of bums me out because I really wish I could go, like, workout and, like, do stuff like that, but it hasn't been working out, so. And I'm looking forward to the weekend because I'm hoping that I'll be able to go out and get on my feet and dance tonight or go out with my boyfriend. And I have a baby shower, uh, that I'll be going to on Sunday, then I'll be seeing some family. So I'm pretty excited for that. And I'm a little nervous and anxious about the net upcoming month because I have so much stuff going on. And, yeah, but whatever I'm on right now has got me not really worried about that because my anxiety's gone, and definitely curious about whatever it is that I have been given. And, yes. I feel very relaxed. Kinda want to go – I feel like doing something still. Like, I wouldn't just want to, like, go and fall asleep. Like, I feel like I would want to go – go do something because it's a really nice day out, and I feel really relaxed, and pretty content and happy right now. So my boyfriend's gonna be picking me up from here, and we sat and talked about getting some food, and we probably will be going and enjoying the nice day. I – I would actually, like, love to take a walk. And whatever I've been given, if I have been given something other than placebo, I don't know what it is, maybe I'm just tired if it is a placebo, but whatever it is I'm pretty relaxed. And I think going out and going for a walk, um, you know, walking along the lake or just exploring, I would like to do that because it seems like it would be pretty fun for me. Um, I think I'd be – it'd be enjoyable since I'm in this state of mind, and my mood feels like this. So, yeah. I was kinda looking forward to playing this game on my iPod called Uzu. Where it's basically like a bunch of consta – star constellations, and psychedelic trip – eye trippy kind of stuff because I didn't know what I was gonna be getting today. But I definitely have a feeling that it's not ecstasy or whatever, the MDMA, because if it was that would probably be pretty enjoyable. But I don’t see any, like, blurred vision or anything. I feel pretty relaxed. I usually have a little bit of anxiety, like, normally, just like a day to day anxiety that's like – it's not really too bad, but it's there. And I don't really feel it right now, so I'm wondering if maybe it's a THC pill or anxiety. Yeah, obviously you can tell that I'm very curious to see what it is because I'm curious to know how substances react to my body as well. But I won't know until after. So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the results. And I could probably chat for a while if someone wanted to sit and have a conversation with me. I probably could, like, relax and just have a slow-paced conversation, but I wouldn't want to be put to, like, any extreme thinking processes right now because I definitely feel kinda lazy, and I don’t really feel like thinking about complex situations or dealing with anything that would be complex right now. I just want to, like, relax. So, luckily, I won't be put to any, or hopefully, I won't be put into any complex tasks. But I don’t think I will, so I think my five minutes is up in five, four, three, two, one. See ya later.\",\n",
       " 'Oh, okay. So, yeah, I\\'m just chilling at the research study place and feeling kinda good. Pretty sure that this is the MDMA just the involuntary eye movements and all that sort. Um, one thing I find weird is that when I wanna talk it\\'s hard to like – my brain is a little scrambled and it\\'s hard to get out what I wanna say clearly without sounding dumb. Um, but, yeah, so I don\\'t really have any plans this weekend other than doing homework and, uh, just went in and get – tried to get another job at Woodfield Mall, which was cool. And I talked to the manager and he\\'s gonna set up an interview with me, so I guess I\\'m just kin-kind of excited about that. Um, pretty stressed out right now in my life, getting close to the end of, um, my time in college got one more quarter left. And I have a lot of homework and loans are about to be dropped on me so I\\'m, yeah, I\\'m got a lot on my plate. But besides all that crap I actually feel pretty good right now and kinda wish I could, like, be outside or be somewhere where there\\'s like, I don\\'t know, music or something I can enjoy because sitting in a room where you\\'re not really doing anything is kind of draining \\'cause, you know, MDMA like brings out all your emotions higher. And I don\\'t think watching The Terminator while I\\'m in here honestly is gonna be a good idea, which I was watching that in the beginning. And I think that that might\\'ve affected my results in the beginning, maybe something to think about, what movies should be watched and maybe just not do anything. Um, kind of feel creative right now like I wanna write or sing or draw or something, something productive. I feel like I\\'m just sitting in here doing nothing and I wanna like go do stuff, like energized. I got good sleep last night and it\\'s a free day so I really wanna go out and do something. Um, I don\\'t know, I think it\\'s wearing off a little bit because when I first felt it I was, like, overwhelmed and it was hard for me to talk, but it\\'s a little easier for me to talk now. Um, yep, and it\\'s kinda awkward to wa – uh, sitting with a recorder and talking to yourself, but that\\'s cool. Um, yep, just chilling, I actually feel pretty relaxed right now, um, overall I feel generally happy, I kinda wish that peak lasts longer because I already feel like the peak\\'s over with. But maybe that was just the buildup, I don\\'t know, because like sometimes when you take MDMA you feel a rush and that\\'s definitely what I felt. And I felt really anxious beforehand and then it kicked in and, um, kicked in and I felt pretty overwhelmed at first and I was like, \"Whoa.\" And then now it\\'s, like, kinda riding it out and I feel like it\\'s less, which I kinda wish that peak last longer or I could feel it longer \\'cause that was pretty nice. But I feel pretty good. I kinda wish I could, like, leave this place and, like, go dancing or something or, like, go and enjoy it, you know instead of just sitting in a room doing nothing. I can\\'t do that, I like – if I\\'m gonna do a psychedelic I need to, like, be doing something stimulating to, like, make an experience out of it. I guess this is a good experience and I\\'m getting some money, so that\\'s pretty cool. So I guess I can\\'t complain. And, uh, yeah, I don\\'t really – don\\'t really mind this, it\\'s not bad. been working anyway, so this is more fun, make money this way, do MDMA \\'cause I know that\\'s what it is. I think my five minutes are up. so I\\'m just gonna let it roll. I keep yawning; I don\\'t know why I keep yawning. MDMA makes me yawn.',\n",
       " \"Hello. So I'm hanging out at the lab right now and I'm feeling kinda blah. Um, looking outside and it seems like it's really nice out and maybe it's because I'm indoors that I feel like this, but, um, I feel really anxious. And, I don't know, before I came in here I was pretty carefree, I felt good and, like, wanted to do stuff today and stuff and go about my day and enjoy my weekend. And right now I just feel, like, anxious and thinking about a bunch of shit that, um, I don't know, it's like all of my own – my responsibilities like school and, like, work and just getting anxious about that I guess. Um, kinda feel like kinda blank-minded actually, like at first I felt like I was feeling like – I don't know, it felt like a ro – like an Ecstasy at first but – because it was really strong and my eyes were twitching and things looked weird. So I feel like I'm on some sort of weird, psychedelic stimulant. Um, but I don't really feel many feelings of, like, happiness or anything, I just feel really blah. And, uh, which is weird because I came here feeling really, really upbeat and happy and upbeat, so, uh, I don't know, right now I'm just chilling, kinda hoping that this shit wears off. And, um, it's weird, I keep yawning and I'm really tired. I feel tired mentally, like my body feels tired and achy but my mind's like wide awake. And, um, my body's wide awake and jittery and I feel like I wanna do something, like, run a mile or, like, go do something athletic, like play a sport. I feel like if I was doing something active I probably would feel really good right now, but just sitting in a chair in, like, a white, blank room is kinda like sucking the energy out of me and making me feel all weird and icky and sad and depressed and lonely even. When, um, I came here I didn't feel like that at all, so I don't really like this whatever it is. And, yeah, I don't know, not really looking forward to the talking task because I feel like it's gonna be about, um, my boyfriend Zach, which right now there's been a lot of stress and, like, um, you know, medical stuff I've been worrying about with him with the doctors and he's been sick lately and it's just been like really stressful. But I love him to death I just – I don't know. Thinking about all that shit makes me stressed out even more and I already feel stress without even talking about it, so I don't know, actually talking about it actually feels a little better. Maybe it's just being active and doing something. Um, as soon as I start talking about something or doing anything to like distract my mind I feel better and I don't feel as anxious. But when I'm just sitting there and, like, my mind's racing and I'm not doing anything then I do feel really, really anxious. Um, I don't like it at all. But I'm sure if I was, like, focused on something right now, like, I don't know, like writing a paper or, like, doing homework I might even be able to do that. But, then again, it's been a little harder to concentrate on things. Um, so, yep, my back is, like, killing me, I'm really achy right now. I pretty much feel like I'm on Adderall kind of, it's like an Adderall-type thing, but it's weird because I'm kinda spacey, cloudy-minded. Usually if I'm just on Adderall I think really clearly and, like, I-I really wanna get stuff done and I, like, wanna do a bunch of things and I don't ever get clouded-minded, which is why this is weird. It's like super-stimulant and maybe, like, the beginning of it was like a little bit of, um, surrealist – surrealism feeling. I don't know.\",\n",
       " \"So I guess I can talk about whatever I want, um, I'm kind of hungry right now because I'm used to eating breakfast every morning and so I didn't eat breakfast, so that's kind of a bummer. And on the computer task there were pictures of a lot of food, so that didn't help. Um, I guess this is awkward because I'm not used to monologuing with myself in a room by myself. So a lot of people talk about the weather I guess, it looks sunny outside. Um, I can kinda see the sun through the blinds and I hope it gets warmer because summer is my favorite season and I like wearing summer clothes. Um, what are my plans for the weekend? So after I leave the session I'm gonna go get lunch with a friend and then I'm gonna go home and probably clean my apartment. I just got back into Chicago and I still haven't unpacked, so I really need to do that. After I clean I might take my dog for a walk or go to the gym, I really should go to the gym but I don't feel like going to the gym. And since it's Friday I'll probably get together with some friends, maybe cook dinner together or go out to eat, I'm not sure. Um, oh, tomorrow, tomorrow's Saturday, so tomorrow we're going downtown to participate in this thing called Summer Dance, which is basically free dance lessons that they hold right on the edge of Millennium Park. And, uh, it's a different band, different instructors every week, but tomorrow is belly dancing I think. So that sounded interesting. So me and a few girlfriends are gonna go and learn how to belly dance, I guess. And afterward we were gonna go to Chinatown to get dinner, which is fun because I really don't go to Chinatown that often as close as it is. So that'll be nice. Um, Sunday I'm just gonna catch up on work I have to do, I guess. I'm gonna try to clean a little more because I have a feeling I'm not gonna clean that much today. So Sunday I'll clean. And next week, what are my plans for next week? I guess I'm gonna just go to work. And not this weekend but the next weekend I'm gonna go back home – well, actually I'm-I'm going to Ohio but I'm gonna visit a friend at a different college. She goes to the University of Toledo, so that'll be a fun time. It's always fun visiting friends at different colleges; kinda see their experience and what they're up to and, yeah. Um, I guess I have to talk every few minutes so you know I'm not sleeping. I kinda wanna take a nap though; maybe I'll take a nap after this session. Oh, I'm getting lunch with my friend, after I get lunch with my friend. I don't really wanna get lunch with him. It sounds bad, but I just have, like, things to do and we're not that close of friends. He's kind of – he's this ridiculous person that I know, but I don't wanna be rude and blow him off because I already said I'd get lunch. Um, I wonder where we're going to lunch. I kinda feel like a sandwich so The Med or Z&H sounds really good. I love Z&H. There's this one sandwich with ham, I forget what it's called and they all have cutesy little names that I never remember, but the ham one's really good, maybe I'll get that. I'll suggest Z&H. I guess we could also go home and cook, that's save money. I've been cooking all week; I'd like to go out. Um –\",\n",
       " \"So on my walk here I was trying to think of topics to talk about during my monologue. Um, I don't know, that's kind of funny, but I was planning on talking about food but I'm not really hungry right now. Um, I guess I thought I would be hungry in the morning before I came. So, um, I just think whoever's stuck with the job of transcribing or re-listening to all of these little recorded tapes and reviewing the heart monitor and trying to – to piece that together, it's gotta be kind of a funny job. I wonder what other people talk about during their monologues, like dish out their life secrets or make confessions or something. That's gotta be kinda funny. I wonder if people talk about really weird, awkward things and maybe most people don't talk. I guess I just am making eye contact with the voice recorder and I feel pressure to talk all the time so the research assistant's job is a little more interesting then when I just sit here in silence. Um, so I noticed their Scrabble and Jumbling Tower in the corner. Do participants play Scrabble with themselves? It's kind of funny. They just, like, get out the building blocks and play Jumbling Tower. I've never even heard of Jumbling Tower, is that called Jenga? Must be like the generic version. Uh, what else, I guess I can talk about my plans for the day. So after I get out of session, um, gonna go home, walk my dog, then I have to babysit at 3:30. I babysit for this family that lives on 47th and Kenwood. I've gotta go pick the girls up and I stay late today because both the parents are out traveling. So I'll stay till 9:00, which I don't mind because it's, what, 3:30 to 9:00 I'm really bad at math, five and a half hours. So that's a lot of money. I'm taking a trip this weekend, I'm going to Toledo. My friend Roxanne, we're gonna go visit friends at a different college, and I could use a little extra money 'cause I know we'll go out and we're gonna wanna go out to eat and might go shopping. So a little extra cash never hurts. Um, what else, I wonder if it's almost time or if I should keep talking. Okay, so first thing that pops into mind, I'm looking at this little metal tray of gauze sponges, rubbing alcohol, stuff like that, it reminds me of the clinic I volunteer at. We have gauze sponges too. Uh, it's a really plain room; you guys should maybe invest in art work. I guess there's a painting back there on that back wall, random rectangles on a red background. I don't really get art like that, I guess I'm not sophisticated enough. I like the really classical 19th century European art that stuff's cool. Uh, but, yeah, this back wall here you could put two more paintings. I can, like, visualize this right now. Um, maybe like a little tapestry, like, string one lengthwise around, like, the wall, that'd be really pretty. This – this computer wall here, it's really kinda drab. I'd like a smaller painting here; you don't wanna take away from your Asian.\",\n",
       " \"So I'm going to talk about being hungry. I don't remember – I don't remember if I talked about food last time. I feel like I did, I don't know. I'm brainstorming topics to talk about again and, um, yeah, I'll talk about food. So maybe you could put, like, a little –little word of advice in here. Um, it's a long time to not to eat, 9:00 to 2:00, just throwing that out there. Maybe we could get a granola bar at the beginning, something to munch on because I'm not used to not eating breakfast and lunch. And now my stomach keeps rumbling on there. And she's putting the sensors on my face or watching these pictures and trying to guess how stimulated I feel, but my stomach's just growling. So, um, my plans with my friends after I get off – get out of here at 2:00. We're gonna go to Mellow Yellow, it's a restaurant on 53rd Street. Um, on Thursday's they have $1.00 mimosas and they have really good chicken and waffles. So just kinda planning on getting some chicken and waffles, which, if you've ever had it, it's really good. I was a little dubious at first of that – that combination, but the hot sauce and the syrup all over the chicken and then the waffle's super fluffy, thick, extra breading. My mouth's watering just describing this. So I'll get my little fruit and nut bar at the end of this, and then excuse me, then I'll walk home to my apartment and I will call my friend Emily and text my friend Daniel who lives across the street. And see if my roommate, Kat, wants to come and we will walk over to Mellow Yellow and then I'll go to work at 5:30. That's my day. Uh, what else, I might get a Coke or something too because I'm feeling a little under caffeinated. I didn't have coffee this morning I think excuse me again. Yeah, I didn't have coffee so I'm feeling a little sleepy. Um, let's see, maybe I'll go home and make a – no we've gotta get to the restaurant since I have to work at 5:30. Uh, what else can I talk about? I need to repaint my nails. I did them the other day and it took me forever. And they look really nice but two on this side just chipped, which is a bummer. I'm trying to put more effort into painting my nails this year looks, I just was lazy last year and never had them painted. But, yeah, okay, what else? Um, probably gonna watch a movie during my little hour break before I get out at 2:00. I was looking at movies on Netflix, there's this one, it's a Spanish film called Mongola, the description looks pretty cool. So I guess I'll maybe watch that. Oh, has it not been five minutes yet? Um, I feel bad for the people who have to transcribe all this, that must be a bummer job. I don't know though, actually it's probably really interesting, all these people just like blabbing when they're on drugs. Probably get some funny stuff. Um, I wonder why there's a baby monitor in here. Oh my gosh, I think it's on, are they listening to me right now? If I like, scream for help.\",\n",
       " 'Um, let\\'s see what should I – um, okay, I guess I\\'ll talk about what I\\'m involved in here, um, at U Chicago. Um, I\\'m in two acapella groups one Ra – is called Ransom Notes, it\\'s a coed acapella group. The other\\'s called Men in Drag, it\\'s all female. Um, I was in both my first year and I quit Men in Drag my second year and I rejoined this year since my workload went down. Um, we – both groups we sing, like, I guess like pop songs or, like, more contemporary songs. Um, Ransom Notes is competing this weekend at the Acapella Fest, um, and Men in Drag is hosting with – along with another group. Um, so we\\'ve been – Ransom Notes has been preparing for that, we had to have choreography and everything. Um, but my number one priority extracurricular-wise here is my band. I started, um, a band last year, um, I would – my first year I performed with my friend Jack who\\'d play guitar and I\\'d sing. We\\'d just perform at random events, um, and then last year – well, we had always talked about wanting to, like, start a band. And so last year, um, he was like – I was like, \"Well, do you wanna perform at this, um, at this thing with me?\" It was for JSA, Japanese Student Association, and so I\\'d sing Japanese songs. Um, and he was like, \"Yeah,\" like – and then he\\'d listen to songs and he was like, \"It\\'d be cool if we could put a bass on there.\" And he\\'s like, \"One of my brother\\'s, he plays bass.\" His, um, his frat brother\\'s. And I was like, \"Cool, go get him,\" or whatever. And it turned out this kid, I knew him, kinda knew him from before, he dated one of my good friends back in high school. He\\'s from Indianapolis too. And so us three performed and then we heard about Battle of the Bands so we decided, um, we would try and get an actual band together. So I got my friend Arielle to play rhythm guitar with us, and then, um, we took – it took forever to find a drummer – well, not forever, we went through, like, four drummers. Every drummer was, like, \"Oh, I actually don\\'t think I\\'ll have the time.\" So it was like three days before Battle of the Bands and I was creeping on this kid on Facebook and I was like, \"Hey –\" well, he – I had met him before but I had only met him like once. And I was like, \"Hey, I saw you play drums, would you be interested in playing with our band and competing in battle of the bands with us. And he was like, \"Yeah, sure.\" So he learned the music real quick and we competed and we won. So after that we were just like, \"Well, we should actually make this a real thing.\" So we, like, performed at other events, we recorded and we were in an online magazine. Um, and we\\'re gonna start writing our own original song – or we\\'re gonna write original music, like, this week. We\\'re gonna try and, um, do that and then perform at various places in Chicago. Um, and I guess, um, another thing I\\'m involved in is rugby. I\\'ve been playing rugby since my sophomore year of high school. Um, just because I wanted to play a sport but, like, all the other sports were varsity sports and everybody had been playing those sports for a long time. So I was like it\\'s either lacrosse or rugby because those are the only two club – like girl club sports and lacrosse is like a pussy sport so I was like, \"No, I\\'m not gonna play that.\" Rugby they actually have the same rules for both girls and guys, so I decided to play rugby. And my first year we were – we had an undefeated season, we won every game and then state championship game we won – we got through semifinals and then at finals we lost by one try to a team that we had beat during the season. So we were really upset about that. But then my junior year we had another undefeated season and we won state and my senior year we had another undefeated season and won state. And since I\\'ve been gone I\\'m pretty sure the rugby team has kept that up having-having undefeated seasons and winning state. Um, yeah, I love my team back in high school, I\\'m – I play here but it, like, doesn\\'t compare to my team in high school. Um, we just played really well together.',\n",
       " 'Um, let\\'s see, what can I talk about? Um, I don\\'t know. Um, I guess I could talk about, hmm, I guess I could talk about my childhood. Um, my mom\\'s Japanese, my dad\\'s black – oh, I guess I could talk about how they met maybe. Um, my dad, he\\'s in the music industry, um, he was in the Marines, um, and after – after you\\'re, like, are done with that you have, like, two years where you have to still stay with the Marines. And he, um, was in California and he was living in these apartments, he said, and he became friends with this group, Atlantic Starr, and they were about to start their tour and they needed someone to help and my dad was about to be done with his thing, with his two year, like, Marine thing. So he was like, \"Yeah, I\\'m down.\" So he, um, he went on tour with them and then he started to get in the music industry. He worked with Marvin Gaye, he worked with MC Hammer, he\\'s worked with a lot of famous people. Um, but when he was here in America, you know, the music scene is like – it was a huge drug scene back then so he got addicted to coke. And he was – I guess he was addicted for 11 years, he said. And then, um, one night at an Earth, Wind, and Fire concert he was backstage and he like overdosed and he fell and hit his head and there was blood everywhere I guess. Um, and he went to the doctor and the doctor was like, \"Yeah, you\\'re fine now but if you do it again you could die.\" So he was just like, \"Shit.\" Well, America – in the American, um, in the American music scene it was all, like, there was so – there were drugs everywhere. Um, so luckily my dad got this call from his friend who was like, \"Hey, um, there\\'s a tour in Japan, do you wanna come?\" And he was like, \"Yes, I\\'m going. I\\'m outta here because I can\\'t be around this.\" In Japan drugs are hor – like, are looked down upon, like, really bad, so, like, even weed. So he thought – took this opportunity to go to Japan, get away from the drugs. Um, then he started working for a hip hop promotion company in Japan, um, and so he got to work with a bunch of artists, he got a company credit card to go out to eat. He had a limo, he\\'d go clubbing. And then I guess he met my mom at a club or he saw my mom at a club and he talked to her and he was like – he told me he told her he was gonna marry her the first time he saw her. He was like, \"You\\'re so beautiful.\" Like, he said she was one of the ladies that would walk into the room and everybody would just turn and look at her. Um, I was like, \"Oh, that\\'s cool,\" whatever. So he told her he was gonna marry her the first time he met her and she was just like, \"Oh, yeah, right, whatever.\" Um, then he started courting her, I guess like taking her out and stuff. And, um, then he said, um, he got her pregnant and my grandparents – Japanese – well, especially my grandparents, like, education is a huge thing. My dad didn\\'t go to college and he\\'s foreign so they were not in support of the wedding at all, they didn\\'t go to the wedding. Um, and my dad\\'s, he thinks they got in a fight beforehand too because she might have told them that she was pregnant before the wedding, anyway, before they got married. He said she showed up, like, it was like raining that day, she was wet, she showed up at his apartment, she was like, \"I\\'m pregnant.\" And so, um, they had a wedding. The guy – the guy who owned the company, the hip hop promotion company, um, he threw my dad and my mom a huge wedding, I guess, like they had people carrying my mom in on one of those seats. They had one of those huge, um – and, yeah, so then they got married. And then they had my brother and my grandparents, I guess, didn\\'t talk to my mom for a long time, um, until my brother was born and then they were finally met with my dad and my mom \\'cause they had a kid. And, um, yeah, so then – and then I was born in Japan too a year later. Um, we were – my mom said she was upset because we were supposed to stay in Japan but –',\n",
       " \"Um, okay, I guess I can talk about, um, what's coming up this weekend. I have a huge concert with my aca – all female acapella group, Men in Drag. We have – it's our 15 year anniversary and we're releasing an album, which we've, like, worked really hard on. So that's cool. Um, I have a solo on this album so I'm really happy about that, it's one of – we have an original song and that's the –that's the song that I have a solo in. Um, most of our songs are not really well known, I guess. I don't really know – know why our repertoire is like that. I wish we had some more well known songs, but I guess it's fine. Um, our album is called Late Night Parades. Um, I don't know, uh, yeah, I was in it – I was in this group my first year and then I quit at the end of the year. And then I rejoined this year, um, so one of my really – one of, like, my best friend's that I made here is in – also in it. So I'm glad she's a year below me, but she auditioned this year and I'm so glad she got in it. We have become, like, really good friends, like, in – just this quarter. Like I met her this quarter and she's great, uh, she's like my little sister. So, um, I don't really know what else to talk about. I guess I'm in Ransom Notes too, which is another acapella group. We're opening for a group called Run for Cover, which is all males. We're – I'm doing – we're doing that tonight. We're not opening for them, but I guess we're their guest group. Um, so, yeah, we'll be at – we'll be performing at that, so a lot of performances. And I have a performance for my art class too, which is my final, so I'm not looking forward to that because I've been messing it up. But hopefully – I'll just have to practice. Um, and I have another final in my Bio class exercise, it's a take home final, though, and we get two chances to take it. So hopefully I'll do well on that one. Um, I'm gonna take it with some other people. Um, my boyfriend's coming this weekend for the concert. We kinda got in a fight this morning, but – or an argument, not really a fight, but I-I don't know, we'll get over it. Um, he's coming from Indianapolis tonight so I'll be really excited to see him. Tomorrow's gonna be a long day, though, because I'm getting my hair done, then – I'm getting my hair done and then I have to – my call time for Men in Drag is 12:00 but I probably won't be done by then. So, yeah, not looking forward to that. Um, but I'm looking forward to the concert, should be fun. Um, I'm going abroad next quarter to Mexico, I'm kinda struggling to find a sub-letter which is really annoying. I really need to find a sub-letter or otherwise I'll have to move out because I can't afford to pay that for three months without getting financial aid. So I'm excited for Mexico though. Um, oh yeah, last night I went out to dinner with my professor and the rest of my class, that was really cool. My professor for Latino studies, he's really cool, I like him a lot. Um, he showed us pictures of when he dressed up as a girl, it was so funny. Um, he's a lot of fun. Um, I don't really know what else to talk about, I don't really have too much to talk about. Um, can't wait to get paid for this. Um, I don't really know – I'm kinda – I'm sad to leave my band next quarter, that's like –\",\n",
       " \"Wow, this is kind of weird. Um, uh, let's see, I kind of think it might be thundering outside, but I'm not sure, some weird weather. Um, I was kind of hoping there would be snow this weekend, but, alas, no. Um, going up to Wisconsin this afternoon to use the darkroom at UW, I'm really looking forward to that. I haven't been in a super – well, I guess it's just that I know the darkroom and I –and I know the enlargers and I know the equipment, so it'll be, uh, not to mention I can spend all night there undisturbed. And it's free. So that'll be really nice. And, uh, hopefully I'll get some decent photos printed. I've really been in a – kind of a dry patch I guess, whatever you wanna call it, or just not focused or lazy or something. Um, what else, um, I'm really looking forward to seeing some pals there and, uh, hanging out, my friend Alexa says she's gonna bake some pies. And she's like – oh, it is thundering. She's like – she would be a perfect 1950s housewife except she's also incredibly smart, et cetera. But her – she cooks such delicious food I'm really excited. Um, and although I did miss the last farmer's market, which is too bad because, uh, I don't know, more delicious food. I think I'm hungry. Uh, what else, as usual I'm a little apprehensive about going up to Madison because of the whole – my ex-boyfriend who I had a very bad breakup and I never wanna see him again. And I wanna, like, exact some kind of horrible revenge on him; I'm worried I might see him. Uh, and I don't know why I'm so worried about it considering I've definitely moved on to better things. But, um, I guess, I don't know, I guess maybe it's partly that I would be worried about behaving immaturely or, like, doing something stupid and mean when it's just kind of unnecessary and I should forget about it. But, you know, I don't know, maybe I'll shit in his mailbox or something ha-ha, yeah. Uh, and let's see, what else is going on? Uh, so hopefully that won't be a part of the weekend. Um, I'm also looking forward to getting out of the house 'cause my roommate decided to take in a stray cat even though we already have two cats. And, uh, I'm already allergic and having a third cat is like over the top dander horribleness. So, yeah, uh, will be nice staying with my friend Andrew. Um, I don't know, hmmm, looking forward to seeing some other people too, and then next week not much is going on I don't think, starting to prep for Thanksgiving feasting. Uh, and, uh, I don't know, I'm kinda hoping I'll get to see this boy I've been, uh, I guess dating sort of, I don't know. Um, but it would be nice to see him, we're talking about going to the movies but, I – I don't know. God, it really is thundering out there. Uh, what else?\",\n",
       " \"Um, what to talk about, um, pretty high on drugs, which I haven't been for awhile. Uh, it's kinda strange, definitely strange being around people. Um, I don't know, I've been – this week I've been sorta feeling a little lonely, I think it's just the start of November, time change, gloom, but I'm generally doing pretty good. Um, this weekend I'm gonna go to a with my friend Jacob, um, and I'm excited for that because Jacob and I, like, have some kind of amazing relationship. Uh, I don't know, he's known me since I guess almost five years now. Um, and we've had some pretty intense adventures together. Um, but the thing I'm pondering over now is whether I wanna smooch him or maybe date him because I know he would be interested and we're definitely astrologically compatible. It's just, I don't know, I mean do I really want to put our friendship at risk that way? Um, what if he is really bad at sex? I don't know. Um, not to mention, like, how fucked up my last relationship was I feel like maybe I should just become a nun or something. But then I might have some other relationship problems, right, creeping myself out now. Um, what else going on this weekend? Uh, more applying for jobs, maybe do some Skyping some overseas friends. Be nice to hang out with my sister a little bit outside of the house. Um, maybe see a movie, I don't know, there's this dude that I'm kinda dating, kinda, I don't know, it wouldn't be bad to see him I guess. But, um, he's like not, I don't know, I like him but I like his body the most. I'm all – I mean, I don't know, I think it's an astrological compatibility, like – or it's just that I am the youngest of four kids and I like to be taken care of in a relationship a little bit. He's not really the, like, snuggle you to death type. But we'll see. Uh, keep talking about boys, kinda boring myself. Um, what else is going on? Maybe I'll go to a film screening on Sunday, um, gotta do some responsible cleaning, personal inventory stuff. Um, write some letters; write a letter to Andy. Do some work; maybe try to write for my own self. I don't know I wish I could have overwhelming confidence in my abilities all the time. And I had that, like, my last month in New York.\",\n",
       " \"All right. All right, so this awkward thing again. It's weird, like, I sort of found myself, like, planning what I was gonna talk about before I came to my session, which is – which says something sad about the state of my mind I guess. Uh, although saying doing Photoshop and writing, like, the most boring copy in the world I guess is enough to make you think about anything. But, let's see, so Thanksgiving is on Thursday, kind of excited, a little nervous. Um, I'm looking forward to sitting around the table with everybody and, um, eating delicious, delicious, food. There's a lot of work that has to get done first and, um, I don't know, I'm also, like, a little anxious because I invited this guy that I really like. But, like, he irritates a lot of people and, like, what if it makes Thanksgiving horrible. But I know I shouldn't really give a shit about that so whatever. Um, this past weekend I took – well, me and my sister and her boyfriend took her boyfriend's little sister to Mitsuwa, which is this Japanese shopping center place in the 'burbs. Um, it's pretty cool, I've been there a few times, but unfortunately this time I was, like, puking my brains out from a mysterious stomach flu, which gross side note I think has moved down to my intestines, yuck. Um, but I think little Ariel had a good time. I don't know it's nice to see someone getting interested in Japan at, like, the same age that I got interested in Japan. I just hope that she doesn't, uh, stumble upon the more unfortunate aspects of that culture because, I mean, she's still pretty naïve. But she has access to the Internet so it's like, I don't know, um, it's probably a good thing that my sister, uh, monitors her email since she is only 11 after all. Um, but, yeah, I hope she sticks with it, I mean she seemed kind of like she wanted to learn Japanese and, um, I don't know, we'll see. Uh, mm, what else, uh, I don't know, I'm just feeling a little spaced out right now. Um, let's see, uh, what else, so I'm also looking forward, sort of, to my birthday in a couple weeks. I feel like for some reason a lot of things are going to, uh, solidify around that time. Um, insert really gross joke about the state of my bowels here, but, uh, I don't know, like, I think I'm gonna hear back about my visa and Japan and maybe get offered another job. I don't know I just got this feeling about it, um, kinda wanna stick around Chicago until, uh, this is silly, but at least my current job's Holiday party. Um because I think it's gonna be kinda fun in, like, a very gay, suburban way. Um, but, you know, bowling and open bar and getting to know people is always nice and the people there are really, really nice to me so.\",\n",
       " 'Hello. My name is Mike. I really don’t know what to say. I’m not really feeling anything crazy right now. I’m happy it’s summer. I’m happy to not be at work. I really don’t have too many errands planned today. I can’t wait to get something to eat though because I’m starving. You’re not supposed to eat two hours before or those were the instructions that I was given, so I didn’t, and I’m very hungry. My best friend is coming in from California today that’s pretty exciting. I haven’t seen him in about two years. I don’t know what we’re gonna do though. I’m usually not too creative about thinking of things to do. Like most of the time people my age go to the bars of catching up I don’t know. I don’t really like to go bars too much these days kind of boring. I used to go out a lot and do a lot of partying but now I just kind of stay at home. I enjoy it more. I don’t like hangovers. I kind of want to move to California or someplace warm. I’m tired of the winter. Most of my close friends have moved away over the last few years. It’s my turn. I’m pretty sure I got a placebo today. I don’t have any sensations that I’m aware of. I came from Wicker Park; the commute was a pain in the ass. I’m not used to getting up so early. Usually I have to be at work at 11:00, and then I get off at 11:00, so I had to get up about 7:00 a.m. today. It’s kind of tedious. Since I got my car, I really don’t want to take the transportation too often. Now and then it’s fun to people watch, but again it’s tedious. You have freak shows, which is some of the fun of riding the public transportation, but it’s also like the bad part of it. I can’t believe I rode it every day for so long. I think I only have a minute left.',\n",
       " 'I really don’t have much to say. I would like to take a nap and I don’t really feel tired. I could really go for a cigarette right now though, a cigarette and a nap but I’m not gonna sleep because I’m not able to. I think I’m supposed to go to a barbecue tonight with some friends. I’m curious to see how the stock market’s doing now see if I made any money today. I was thinking about going on vacation in a week to Key West. Don’t really have anything planned today might go downtown with my partner, and then obviously we have that barbecue later. I don’t really know if I want to go to that we’ll see. It was such a busy week. Two hours and ten minutes to go and then I can go home. She should be coming back in here any second now. Big stretch.',\n",
       " 'Yep, feel fine. I don’t know what they gave me but it feels like it’s pretty much warn off. I’m a little fatigued that’s about it. I’m curious to learn more about this study and what the researchers are looking for. I really don’t have too much to say. I might go see a movie today after I take a nap. Seeing how I’m feeling I don’t think I’m gonna be able to work out after this, and I’m anxious to eat. But otherwise I feel fine. Yep, that’s pretty much all I’ve got to say. I feel bad. She’s gonna want to come in and talk about the dialogue I guess about somebody in my life, and I really don’t really want to talk at all. I feel so forced. Hello. A few minutes left. I’ve got to go grocery shopping today. Boy am I hungry.',\n",
       " 'Okay, I guess I’m supposed to just randomly talk about stuff. Well, I’m going to talk about my plans for the rest of the day. Hopefully I get out of here on time so I can go meet up with my friends and we can, what do I have to do? I have to put up a gazebo today and that’s gonna be so fun. I really wanna do that. Then I have to go take a shower and find something to wear for tonight because I’m supposed to be going to a party. I really don’t feel like doing much of anything though. I’m really hungry right now. I want a cheeseburger but not from McDonalds though, not that McDonalds crap. I want like Checkers, I’m going to Checkers after this. That’s what I’m gonna do and I want some chili cheese fries with like a cheeseburger, extra bacon on it and onions and lettuce. Oh, my God. I’m so hungry. Enough about that, then after I shower and eat and play with the gazebo, I don’t know what we’re gonna do after that, probably gonna go pick up a bunch of people and pregame or something and then once we get done with that we’re gonna stumble towards the party and I’m gonna throw away three or four hours of my life that I’m probably not gonna remember and then I’m gonna come home and pass out and wake up. Then on Sunday, what am I gonna do? I have to go see my grandfather and my mom and that’s really it. I don’t have any plans for Sunday. So I think I’ll just sit around my house all day and watch TV for once. Oh, wait. Tonight is game seven of the play-offs Eastern Conference finals Celtics Heat so I’m gonna watch that at some point. That’s gonna be awesome. I feel like I’ve been talking for a long time. I have nothing else to say. I don’t think. All I can really think about right now is being hungry. I really really want a cheeseburger more than anything right now. I gotta get something from McDonalds. That’s all right. I feel like listening to music right now, either listening to music or eating. That’s the only thing I care about right now. I need to find a ride home because I don’t wanna get on the bus. I can’t believe I’ve been here for three hours. I’m starving. I’m really hungry. After this, I just need to sit here and chill. Sweet. I don’t have to do much but wait. This is so boring. I need to wash my face. Okay.',\n",
       " 'Session 2 okay well this time around I am really really tired I would want nothing more than to just lie and take a quick nap for a while, that would be awesome. This week went by really fast and now it’s the weekend, I really don’t know what I’m gonna do today. I don’t really have any plans, probably just gonna end up going home and going to sleep. I’m supposed to go to the movies with Cindy; I don’t feel like it anymore, I’m just really really tired and hungry actually. I think when I go home I’m gonna have a hamburger or something like that I don’t know. Let’s see my birthday is coming up in two weeks, really excited about that. I just ironed out the plans of the entire weekend and now it’s just a matter of waiting and getting everyone together so we can figure out what we’re gonna I mean not what, when and where all this stuff is gonna happen. First of all, we rented out this bar but the night before my birthday. And that’s supposed to be really cool, I’ve never been but I hear it’s really really cool. And we get to go there and have fun and then we’re gonna go have a picnic the next day that’s gonna be cool I always like picnics. I don’t know what we’re gonna have to eat though we’ll have to figure that out. Probably just BBQ, simple stuff, then the next day I don’t know what we’re gonna do, we really need to find something it is July 1st. Oh yeah I think that’s what we’ll probably do, so it’s a pretty busy weekend. I hope I’m talking loud enough, tend to not talk loud enough. Oh wait I know what I’m doing today that’s what I’m going to do. First things first I really wanna take a nap and eat a bowl of coco puffs or maybe a cheeseburger and some French fries. Sounds like a plan, then we gotta do that. Oh, I hope I can find a ride home because I really don’t feel like taking public transportation today. I can’t think of anything but going back home, I’m really hungry. I wonder what time it is. I hope I have enough time to go home before I go to the movies because if not I’m not going to the movies. Cindy will just have to understand although I don’t think she will this is longer than the five minutes but every time I look not that long. Only a little bit of time left. Man I just don’t feel like doing anything today, I just wanna do the sleep I’ll be so happy when I can take a nap.',\n",
       " 'Monolog task three session three. Let’s see today is Friday, which is weird for me because I’m normally used to being around Saturday. So I’m adjusting to that quite nicely I guess. And let’s see today, I am reading a comic book. It’s about batman and superman and all of those guys saving the world like they do. It’s really interesting actually. I’ve never really gotten into comic books, even though I’ve always wanted to. Because, I don’t know I thought they were lame growing up. Or rather, I should say, I thought everyone else thought they were lame growing up. So I didn’t get into them because of what people might think of me, which is lame in itself if you think about it. But I didn’t. My birthday is coming up in eight days. I am so excited for it. This is like the first time since I turned 21 that I’ve been excited for a birthday. So it’s going to be pretty awesome. Pretty awesome. I have the whole week planned out pretty much. It’s going to be ridiculous. But that’s not until next week. What I need to concentrate on is what I’m doing when I get out of here, because I don’t know. I really really don’t know. I think I’ll go to McDonalds or something even though I hate McDonalds. McDonalds is so gross. But it’s the closest thing to my house, which sucks. I really really really want to go downtown or to the movies when I leave here. But there is nothing out that I want to see, so I don’t think I’ll be doing that. But I could, I don’t know, I might. It’s possible. Maybe if I find someone to go with me I’ll go. That would be cool. I want to see That’s My Boy again, because that movie is awesome. But there are also a few other movies I would like to see that would be cool. I haven’t seen – I want to see Brave. I think that comes out today. It’s supposed to be big. Right now, I am currently digging dirt from everyone else. Isn’t that funny. Oh my god, I’m so hungry. You know, I could have ate this morning if I would have woke up early enough, but that just didn’t seem like the smartest thing to do. I don’t like getting up early for anything. So that didn’t happen. When I get home, I’m going to make myself lunch I suppose even though I don’t feel like it. Maybe I’ll con someone into doing it for me. That’s the smart thing to do. So yea, when I get home, I’m going to convince someone to fix me lunch. Then I’m going to eat it, and then I’m probably going to go back to sleep for a while until the sun goes down because it’s way too hot to be outside today. Then after that, I’m going to go hang out with a couple of friends I suppose. I haven’t seen Katie and Ashley in like two weeks. So I need to go hang out with them. I wonder what they’re doing right now. Huh, probably nothing. I feel like I’m rambling because I have nothing to talk about right now. But it doesn’t matter. I will continue to ramble on about absolutely nothing because that’s what I’m supposed to do. And I always do as I’m told, not always, but most of the time. Man that game last night was so awesome. I wouldn’t have had the ending come any other way, then for the Heat to blow out the Thunder. That’s on record. Yep, it was awesome. Freaking awesome. But why – why is someone cutting grass at 11:00 in the morning on a Friday? Seems like Saturday work. Just saying.',\n",
       " 'Okay, so I guess I’m supposed to talk for five minutes now again. Just talk for about two or three. I had an error with the machine, so I’m supposed – supposedly supposed to start talking again. Um, I think it’s supposed to be nice outside today, but all the blinds are closed so I can’t really tell. But, they say it’s supposed to be sunny out. So, I’m thinking that I probably got a placebo today, either a placebo or really dosage of cannabinoid of some kind, THC. I haven’t really felt much. I felt a little something earlier I thought, but tough to say. Certainly not any large quantity of anything noticeable, which is fine. Just started reading this new book on my Kindle this morning on the way in on the bus. I’m not sure if it’s gonna be good or not. It seems pretty unusually, but we’ll see whether or not I’ll be able to get into it. Not sure what people usually what say when they’re talking to themselves on a microphone like this, but I’m having a hard time figuring out what to come up with. Starting to get hungry. It smells like people are having lunch out there. Hoping I get a job around here soon. I mean, this isn’t the worse thing I’ve every done, but it’s certainly not great. So, uh hopefully that will happen in the near future here. I have these interviews lined up and just starting with.',\n",
       " 'So, it’s supposed to be another beautiful day outside. I can’t really see anything right now because all the shades are drawn, the blinds are shut, but I’m pretty sure it’s supposed to be like sunny and 85 today. Um, got Labor Day Weekend coming up this weekend, so that’s something to look forward too. Um, got my girlfriend coming into town for the weekend on Friday so that will be fun. What else? Tigers blew a game last name they should have won. Pretty disappointing to watch that. Um, I have an interview tomorrow morning with United Airlines, so hopefully that goes well. It sounds like a decent position. Hard to talk to yourself out loud like this; it’s the strangest thing. I don’t know what you’re supposed to say. I’d be interested to hear what other people say in the similar circumstance. Um, so I’m pretty sure I got MDMA today. That’d be my guess. Whatever I got definitely is a higher dose than I got the last time, which was pretty minimal, but I’m pretty sure it’s MDMA which is fine with me. I need some more fun. Football season’s right around the corner here. I got some games on tomorrow, college football games. Good games on Friday, good games on Saturday. I know about Michigan, Alabama, excited to see it but uh Alabama’s tough. I don’t know if we’re gonna be able to beat them. Three minutes and 35 seconds so we’ve got a little time to go on this yet. It feels like it’s been about 20 minutes. I’m still here I just have nothing else to report. Over and out.',\n",
       " 'So, I hope it quits raining by the time I leave here. Pretty dreary when I came in this morning. It’s supposed to get pretty hot, like 90 today maybe, but we’ll see what happens. Um, so I’m pretty much certain that I got a placebo today, which is fine. Not quite as fine as when you get the mbma, but you know it’s all right. Um, third time I’ve been into these. I kinda feel like I’m getting the hang of this little routine, so it’s getting a little bit more comfortable. First game of the NFL season starts tonight, the Giants and the Cowboys. Looking forward to having some NFL games back on to watch. Uh, I got my fantasy football team drafted last night and they’re looking real good. I think I might be looking for a win this year, which is always nice. I’m still here; I don’t really have anything to say. So the Michigan, Alabama game on Saturday was a disaster, but that was about to be expected. Alabama’s real good and Michigan’s decent, but they got throttled. So, we’ll see what happens from there, but not the ideal start to the season for them. Another minute of this it looks like. Still here.',\n",
       " \"All right, so one of the-one of the coolest things that, uh, I got to do last year in physics lab is, uh, an experiment, uh, to measure what's called hyperfine splitting, which is, uh, the splitting is between energy levels in an atom. Uh, which are generally too-too-too small to see with like a conventional sort of spectroscopy experiment. See, normally what you do is you have a bunch of atoms in a tube and you shoot a laser at them. And, uh, if that laser is at the frequency of a transition in the atom then the atom will emit light, and, uh, basically so what you do – and once you know specific transition frequencies for the atoms then you can fine the-the splitting between those frequencies, which tells you the splitting's between the energy levels. Which I guess for some people is something you'd wanna know, atomic structure. Not a big fan, but, anyways, so you get, uh, so normally what you do is you shoot a laser and, uh, you would scan it across a range of frequencies and you would see at which frequencies in that range they would be – atoms were being. And then you could find the differences, uh, between those and that would give you, uh, that would give you the energy splitting. And the general idea of how the atomic structure works. Now the problem with this is is that with atoms usually this is done in a tube full of atoms that are in a gaseous form, but, uh, the thing is is that you have all these atoms in a gas that all have some average velocity given by the temperature and they're all bouncing around. But they're all going different random directions, and that means that if they're moving when they see the laser they're gonna see it a Doppler shifted frequency, they're shifted higher or lower. So instead of seeing, you know, one nice, narrow peak at the transition frequency you see a big, broad, narrow peak that is the sum of all the little, tiny, narrow peaks from atoms moving at different velocities. Um, that's really hard to, uh, just-just sort of talk about without a picture, but, uh, the bottom line is instead of a bunch of little spikes and, like, on a cone you have a big, wide hill, which doesn't tell you anything because you wanna know the-the-the width between the spikes. Now the cool thing that some guy came up with, and I don't remember who did this experiment, but, uh, what he came up with was, uh, if you shoot, uh, do the same experiment, uh, with the laser going through and then you have a detector and you see what atoms are excited, basically, at the detector. And, uh, but the trick here is what you do – what they do in addition to that is they take the same beam that they're shooting through that's, you know, scanning across frequencies, and they split part of it, they split about 98 percent of it, and they send it around, uh, with two mirrors and bounce it back through the tube the other way. So like away from the detector. And what this does is it saturates the atomic transition in the tube, um, so that, uh, the only atoms that you're actually seeing are, uh, with your-with your beam going forward into the detector are atoms that have no velocity along the laser because all the ones that have velocity along the laser have already been excited. Um, so ones with zero velocity along the laser, well, something like that. Um, no, sorry, what it is is that, uh, if you're being hit on both sides by a laser the only-the only-the only way you're gonna actually, uh, be excited by both lasers is if you have no velocity along the laser because otherwise you're gonna get vel – you're gonna get excited by one laser or not the other, or the other laser and not the first one. So what you get is, uh, in fact in that big, broad thing where you wanna just see a little-a little cone with spikes you see little tiny dips at the actual transition frequencies. It's very interesting. And we did this in the lab, uh, built a big optics board, um, and, uh, you know, got to use something like a 100 megawatt laser, which is incredibly powerful, instant eye damage, like blindness in a second. So nice, big safety goggles though, we were all alright. And, uh, yeah, we had a tube full of, uh, gaseous rubidium, which is apparently an important molecule to know the energy levels of, I'm not quite sure why but I think that was the original Nobel Prize winning experiment, which we were replicating. But, uh, yeah, it was-it was pretty-it was pretty fantastic to see-to see that actually, like, shooting lasers at each other through-through a glass tube. And the result of that is you get, you know, an idea of the structure of the atom. And, uh, I mean usually-usually, uh, you pick rubidium and you pick other, uh – that's the end, okay.\",\n",
       " \"All right, so there's a lot of-there's a lot of weird issues in, like, like, modern physics these days. And, uh, one of the coolest demonstrations I've ever seen here is sort of an experiment we did in the lab last year. It was, uh, is, uh, something called single photon interference, which is, uh, 'cause there's two – you know, there's these two ways of looking at light, there's the classical way where light is like a wave. It's just like an e-electrical magnetic field, like, traveling through space. And, you know, when it bounces off of something it excites an electron and get the photo-electric effect, and then you get light reflected in your eyes and you can see the color of various objects in the world. Um, as long as they're in the visible spectrum. But, uh, one of the coolest ways of sort of looking at this – there's also sort of a dichotomy I guess because, uh, or a duality if you will, I guess, is, uh, because light can also be thought of as a particle. And, uh, and sort of the way you think about that is it's not like a physical particle like an electron or proton or a neutron, but it's, uh, it's a discreet little wave-like packet basically. And, uh, but we can think of it as a particle. Anyways, so there's, uh, so there's an experiment that you can do where, um, you have, uh, you have a little black box. And basically what it will do is if you fire light in, uh, in one direction it will split it 50/50. So 50 percent of the light will continue traveling straight and the other 50 percent of the light will travel to the side at a right angle to the original beam. So you have sort of, uh, if you-if you can imagine sort of a rectangle with this beam splitter at the bottom left corner, then, uh, then you have one beam going up the left side of the rectangle and one go – one beam going, uh, across the bottom side of the rectangle. Now at the top left corner and the bottom right corner you have mirrors that reflect both beams into the top right corner of the rectangle where you have another one of these 50/50 beam splitters. So you have one beam coming from the bottom into the-into the second beam splitter and one beam coming from the left. And this beam splitter will recombine, um, sort of, you know, so the beam coming from the bottom half of it will go up and half of it will go to the right. And then the beam coming from the left half of it will go up and half of it will go to the right. And, uh, and so if light is a wave when it hits – when you hit the first beam at the bottom left corner you interpreted that splitting of the beam is just half the energy if the wave goes one way and half the energy if the wave goes down the other path. And then when they recombine you get all the energy again and the wave back as it was. Um, but if you're looking at it in the, uh, in the quantum mechanical sense, the photon sense then it can't split in two at the interferometer – at the, uh, at the beam splitter. So what happens instead is, uh, we say that there's a probability that it goes one way or the other, each particle. And then the splitting of the beam is, like, so you have maybe half your particles going up and half your particles splitting to the right. Now the experiment that we did was trying to look at individual photons, so that, uh, instead of having like, you know, part of your – like half your photons go up, half of them go to the right you have one photon. And you're dealing with the probability that that goes either up or to the right. Now the tricky thing is is that quantum mechanics says that you can't actually know which path it went down. Um, well, let's not put it that way, it's, uh, it will act-it will act as sort of, uh, if you don't know which path it went down then it went down both paths. You have one discreet photon, but if you think of it in terms of probability then you have a 100 percent proton – uh, photon going in and probability wave of 50 percent each coming out of both the-the-the top and the right side of the first beam splitter. And, uh, so when these probability waves recombine there's, again, a 100 percent chance that a photon comes out the other side and at that point, at the top right corner of the rectangle, your second beam splitter, uh, it's either gonna go up or it's gonna go to the right. Now, uh, the trick here is that if you – if the – this is if the path links to the exact same then you get, you know, interfere – you get constructive interference, but if you vary the path lengths then you have the waves, us, interacting in sort of, uh, a possibly destructive way. If one – if they're out of – if, uh, you know, one wave is at a peak while the other ones at a valley and they both hit the beam splitter at the same time then, uh, then you get destructive interference, you get –\",\n",
       " \"Um, so like this summer I've been, uh, working at the library, Regenstein library, it's, uh, it's a great job, I really enjoy it, uh, one of two students in, uh, a department of about six or seven people. Um, my partner is a good friend of mine, uh, and, uh, we do-we do the computers for all the staff in the library. And, uh, you know, for awhile I thought I had one of the best jobs in the world, it was great. You know, you hang out all day if someone has a computer problem it's usually, like, teaching, like, you know, someone from the older generation who's not used to using computers, like basic computer skills. The number of people I've showed how to use, like, CTRL + C is absurd. It's – anyways, so, I was like – and then when there's no problems you just kinda hang out and, you know, get paid $15.00 an hour to breakdown boxes or whatever. Not bad. But as it-as it went on I started realizing that it may-may, in fact, be one of the worst jobs in the world because my job is essentially to troubleshoot Windows 7, that's what it comes down to. And, like, yeah, after doing it for about a year now I'm getting better at understanding Windows, but I still hate it. It's a terrible – it's bad, it's, uh, I mean, you know, you understand it's like, you know, it's really designed for enterprises, nobody else makes a computer like that, like domains and all that administrative crap. And they're good for that, but it's just – there's so much that is wrong with the way that they do things, personally, my-my opinion. But, uh, yeah, I think a lot of other people's opinion. But, yeah, but, uh, no, the job is nice, access to a lot of powerful resources, um, you know, when you're the people putting out the staff computers, you know, you get to have a really – you know, the nice, like, top of the line one. And we save those for ourselves in the department. But, uh, it's been really good, I mean it – I was – it was – it's really taught me how to sort of be in a service position. In a lot of points, you know, you're dealing with people who don't really understand and you sort of just have to smile and nod and be as helpful as possible, which is something I don't think I could have done a year ago. I tend to get im-impatient and frustrated with people who, like, can't use technology. So I would say that's quite a valid skill, whether it's something I'd actually wanna use ever, like put into work it's – I don't know. Being an IT guy for the next 20 years sounds really, really shitty, that's just what I would-just what I would say. But, uh, I don't know, it's a-it's a good student job, you know, you get paid hourly. Um, the people in the department are really chill, relaxed, my boss, this guy David, is, uh, is a great-is a great manager. He knows exactly what to say at every moment, um, especially because people-people sometimes have, like, the-the tendency to, uh, sort of blame everything on the tech people when it's like, well, you know, you can't-you can't really do that, it's, like, not my job to fix. It's your job. It's not my job to, like; fix the Wi-Fi on your personal laptop at your house. But, uh, he's really good. See, personally, I would be-I would-I would be kind of a dick about that, but he's really good at being friendly and just telling people how it is and, I don't know, it's given me respect for, like, people who, like, go to school to learn how to be managers, you know? Because it is a skill and this guy's good at it. Um, yeah, just a lot of smart competent people, get to hang out and, um, it's good. I don't know-I don't know-I don't know how we're doing for time but, uh, I think this weekend is gonna be a good weekend. I'm going to a beer tasting tonight, should be pretty good. Um, got maybe like 30-30-30 different kinds of beer from all over the world. I'm excited for that. And then, uh, a friend of mine's having a party, uh, a poker night kind of deal, some barbecuing. I might be down, I'm not sure if I'm gonna go to that because, uh, I don't know if this was a joke or not, but he's like, you know, this is like, you know, guys night, no women allowed, grilling, poker, drinking, that's it. Could be fun but I do need-I do need to get out there and meet some girls though. Might have to dip out from there early. Another friend of mine's having an apartment party, uh, grand opening, just moved in and, uh – oh, there it is.\",\n",
       " \"Olympus brand video – voice, rather, recorder, hmm. Made in China. I do wonder why it is the Greek myths that have become so prominent in our minds. You think the Romans, perhaps, would have had more of a sway on that considering they usurped the gods, more or less, from the Greeks. But for whatever reason, at least in this culture and this day it really seems like the Greek ones have precedence. Hmm, hmm, Olympus, the mountain of the gods, I'm curious, will we ever reach a point where electronics or any sort of, uh, merchandise will market itself on its mediocrity because everything has to be top of the line, imperion as it were. Olympian – but we can only go so hide, presumably, fidelity can only be so much. Hmm, watching the clock slowly tick away as I have very little to say. Hmm, so many logos in this room alone, we're already inundated from the marketing techniques of 50, 20, even 10 years ago, how much further can we take it before we have to just start deliberately, subliminally planting ideas directly into people's brains. Well, probably not directly but at least through a more – either subtle or ridiculously over the top method of visual, audio, or eventually tactile stimulation I assume. Hmm, how much further can the graphic artists take us, and what will be when we hit that point? I don't know I'm just bullshitting 'cause I gotta keep talking eventually. Scrabble? Been in the same form for so long and they just recently added the ability to add p-proper nouns and abbreviations into it. I don't think Orwell ever saw that new speak coming from Hasbro, pretty sad. The arbiters of what is truly as word have fallen, 'cause if we don't have real Scrabble what does our language really mean anyway? Bollocks, bollocks is what it means. And a desktop computer already antiquated, how much more so next year.\",\n",
       " 'So, the monologue task. I am, uh, fairly inquisitive by nature. I\\'m curious what scientific datum you expect to glean from the monologue task. Is it my inflections? Is it my annunciation abilities while doped up, as it were? Is it the subject matter? I don\\'t expect answers, I just have to talk, and that\\'s what occurs to me. I\\'m curious, do you – what do you attribute to the drug, and what do you attribute to my natural sense of whimsy, \\'cause I have quite a bit of that. Where\\'s the fun if not a little bit whimsical, eh? Anyway. Always happy to give the scientists something to ponder since it\\'s what you\\'re doing anyway, right? How do you manage to slice all this up, and slab numbers on it? I\\'ve done a bit of research in my time. I\\'m not sure how you\\'re working this. It\\'s all some scheme, isn\\'t it? Some sort of secret government plot to introduce soma. Yes, I\\'ve read Brave New World, and it\\'s great. Hmm, who decided the second was the best means of attributing time passage? And whatever happened to the first half? Exactly. You don\\'t know. I do, and I won\\'t tell you. Hmm. I\\'m more curious because you don\\'t have audio of me not on drugs. Well, unless this is a placebo, and I have incredibly suggestible mind. That seems unlikely, though. I\\'m pretty good at discerning drugs effects. I\\'ve done a few in my time. So what do you compare it with, other people? That\\'s hardly fair. They couldn\\'t possibly compare. No. Hmm. Well, here we are, just you and me, Mr. Voice Recorder, and then the evanescent being on the other end, who\\'s presumably listening to this now, despite the fact that now hasn\\'t happened yet for me. But that\\'s the beauty of time recording. I hope you\\'re at least mildly entertained. I am. The seconds tick away, but now I\\'m immortalized in aggregate. Is it enough? I suppose we\\'ll have to find out, won\\'t we. And by \"we,\" I mean people we don\\'t know.',\n",
       " 'Well, now it\\'s just you and me, voice recorder. But ultimately it will be you and me and whoever is taking this down. So this is to you whoever is on the other end of this. I hope you\\'re having fun, I am, and, uh, you know, I hope this isn\\'t boring for you. I picture what you look like, who are you? What is it that brought you to this place where you are writing my words, the words that mean absolutely nothing to me? But, goddamn it, there\\'s science to be had in these words apparently. And, uh, yeah, do you write down emphasis? If I were to change like this would you actually, you know, put it down in some sort of brackets \"Adopts a British accent for a brief while?\" Or do you just write it down verbatim, I don\\'t know but I\\'m curious. And you know what? Exactly. Did you put \"brief pause\" there or did you just wait until I said exactly? See, I, uh, I\\'m intrigued by you and I\\'ve never met you. Or have I? I don\\'t know, for all I know you\\'re one of the people I\\'ve already worked with. But, uh, yeah, oh man, your job, or task or whatever. Do you do this all the time? Is this your dedicated task or are you just somebody they hire for this briefly or are you another student who has this as one of their many unpaid tasks? I don\\'t know but I hope you appreciate this \\'cause it\\'s for you, the unsung hero. Anyhow, uh, let\\'s see, almost three minutes gone, our time is nearly up. Have you enjoyed it so far? I have. You and your effervescent evanescent constant question mark in my mind of who or what you are and, who knows, perhaps this transcript will survive for generations to come. You never know. That\\'s the thing about the future; you never know what survives from the past. Will this be, perhaps, a lost relic of our age, centuries past and your work will live on? And you know what? You won\\'t care because you\\'ll probably be dead like me in centuries. I suspect anyway. It\\'s possible; they have said that, uh, we may, in fact, cure mortality in the next 60 years. But, then again, we may, for that matter, cure life in the next 60 years, who knows. We might just kill ourselves. Or we might live forever, who knows, it\\'s possible we could do both or neither. Um, you know, a lot of possibilities out there. Four and a half minutes, we\\'re almost done, can you make it? I can. I hope you\\'ve been having fun \\'cause I have. Oh goodness, this is just too damn funny to me. My mind just likes to think about as many things as possible at once, even while heavily sedated, at least I think I am.']"
