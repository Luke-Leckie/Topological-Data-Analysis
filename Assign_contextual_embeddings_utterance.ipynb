day of school and um, we have been friends for four and a half years before we started dating we started dating after we moved three hours apart from each other which really sucked and then um, he moved to chicago so i came here also and now we’re living close to each other the first time in a while, it’s really nice um, he’s a weird person he a lot of, my friendship with him wasn’t um, i never thought i would date him he wasn’t an important you could talk to this person, he was just always fun and yeah, yeah and now when i see pictures of him in school or us in school, he’s two different people, it’s really bizarre because he’s changed a lot and matured a lot and um, he’s very kind, very hard on himself and um, he, right now he’s working for the government he he never thinks that he’s doing enough but he’s the youngest person working where he’s working, it’s really cool um, so he’s in a nine month training program and goes in everyday and sits in a classroom so he’s kinda going a little crazy um, he also just joined a bowling league and his first day was yesterday.', 'yeah and um, he’s from the midwest which i think is a big part of him too he’s definitely got some of the midwest stuff in him but he’s really smart also and he’s incredibly fashionable he has really great taste in clothes and movies and everything even just putting a room together, he’s able to do that and i think that’s really cool because i have really bad taste so it’s really cool living with him because he’s really good about it but um, yeah exactly, he gets really crazy sometimes though he likes to go really crazy when he parties and um, but he also has really severe anxiety sometimes and he gets really upset about things so it gets really weird when he gets upset because he keeps it all inside and then eventually it’ll, it explodes once he was mad at me and i didn’t know about it and he pulled me out of my room in the middle of the night and started screaming at me in the hallways and i said, oh wow but it was, it’s like tough love and it really, its fits him really well and it’s great being his friend here because he’s a really honest opinion of things and he’s really straight forward about it, unless he’s keeping it inside which is unhealthy but it’s the way that he does things so and um, he wants to go into fashion consulting but the business side of it he was an econ major for a while but i think it was too hard for him so he stopped, so but he works really hard and he’s um, he’s in moda, which is one of the clubs and he’s really in charge of it and i think it’s really impressive because it used to be, it was always cool but he made it really cool and interesting and, he actually designed a line for the fall fashion show.', 'and um, but he i just i think he looks up to me he went vegan immediately after i went vegetarian which is either an admiration thing or just the one up thing, i’m not really sure and um, but he’s always borrowing my books or hanging out in my room when i’m not there, after i moved away and um, he just i definitely have a special affection for him because we’re so similar and because i think we have so much in common and um, i like him a lot i think he’s really cool, he is turning into a cool person i like watching that and it’s just funny to, what else do i say um, ’t i i’ve always just kinda hung out with him more like he’s my friend than my brother and i like bringing him to things i like introducing him to people and he gets along with a lot of um, my friends and he used to be really, really quiet and shy and very um, keeping to himself but he’s definitely since getting more involved in high school getting a lot more sociable and he’s just got a really cool interesting personality he has a lot of friends now when he didn’t before in junior high and so that xxx yeah, he’s opened up a lot more which is really cool and he’s had it’s just cool to watch him and my sister get so into high school in a way that i never did socially and, extracurricular he’s um, he’s a runner, he’s a really great runner uh, insanely always is second place and whatever race he is in, first or second and um, he’s just very um, ’t i’m not sure what else to say i just like him a lot i’m looking forward to seeing him tomorrow um, i’m always trying to get him to come hang out with me in chicago and see different things and come stay with me when he can because i do look out look out for him in a way that i don’t, my other siblings and he just he is also just very emotional.', 'and he’s just had special relationships with all his kids and doesn’t play favorites but like i said i think we just he just has never made me feel bad about anything um, except for my math skills well, but only because he wants me to do well and he’s just he’s just a very good person and he’s uh, i just i like him a lot i just like spending time with him a lot he’s very funny and he just um, yeah i just think i’ve learned from him a lot how to interact with other people and just just riffing about my dad, on my dad um, but he’s just he’s nonstop he’s always working, he’s always doing things um, around the house um, um even moving on little sleep and ’t i just like his attitude about things.', 'and um i i feel like more recently, within the past couple of years, i’ve been able to come with him, come to him with problems and things like that i always felt like it was kind of weird talking about certain things like that, just certain problems and stuff, just because, ’t but i i feel like now, more than ever, it’s like um he’s much more receptive to that kind of thing and um i feel like he’s been, he’s been giving pretty helpful advice he’s been telling me that he’s been, he’s been pumping out good advice on all different kinds of levels.', 'okay, um, christie is someone i met my first year of college coming in and um i met her because she was in my house in the xxx and she lived across the hall from me um so it’s actually kind of funny how, well she is my best friend right now so, um it is actually kind of funny how we became best friends because um, i liked this guy and then um, this guy started to like her so then, um i i actually started to get jealous and um, i was jealous of her but then um, then later on i started to help them get together um so then we we started talking a lot and and um so we kind of became friends through him um which is kind of weird because then later when they broke up we didn’t talk to him anymore so it’s like he disappeared um from the picture and um now we’re really good friends um, and we had our ups and downs too um so, i think first year we were closer i think um we’ve drifted apart somewhat but i think that we are always going to have a really strong bond no matter how um many bad things we go through.', 'um, it was really hard for us to separate because we went to the same school together up until the end of high school um so when he went to college, um, when he went to college, i was going through a rough time, actually, and i hadn’t gone to college yet because the university of chicago starts later and, um, he he left, and he was kinda my support at the moment, and, um, when he left it was really hard because i felt i couldn’t really talk to anyone else like i could with him um, so yeah, i really i really missed him um, he comes to visit sometimes he came to visit u of c about three times, and every time he comes to visit it’s it’s really great.', 'so it looks bad his tattoos, and he’s very pale, but anyways, he got a tattoo of a milkman, but it’s a, it’s a, it’s a skull it’s a guy in a skull and he’s in a milk outfit, and he’s got it on his shoulder it looks ridiculous, but i told him it looks good and um, so that’s yeah, yeah it’s like that i’ve known him for a long time like i said um he works for southwest airlines he lives with his old man in chicago, and uh he helps him out because he had cancer, and he’s got a bunch of problems so, and they’re divorced his parents all my friends’ parents are divorced, it’s really weird, mine aren’t, but um he works at southwest he was never the greatest in school but we hang out a lot though sometimes.', 'it’s only a half hour away or whatever but he came down and we had dinner and it’s just he never makes me feel bad for doing stupid things the fourth time of locking keys in the car or whatever, he would never um, we fought out in high school because my grades weren’t the best but since college um, everything’s kind of leveled out and we have a really good relationship i like talking to him he’s very we have similar views on things he’s very well read he’s just very smart i just think he’s a cool guy he’s just he’s a good person um, he just uh, ’t.',

school too, so um it kinda works out he’s going to school for physical therapy um well, first, he has a business degree, so uh he had to get science prerequisites first, so he’s working on that and uh, he is, he’s really funny, which is a good thing to have.', \"he really likes video games, like a lot of sixteen year old boys um he doesn’t play sports; he played t ball, i think, when he was

let's see, i’ve met a few of his friends and they’re all really dorky, just like him um he has a lot more female friends that i had male friends in high school though, probably because of band, he hangs out with them all the time um one of his best friends is my mom’s best friend’s daughter so it’s pretty cool, i guess and they all hung out on new year’s eve and had a party sort of thing, i guess.\", 'i was very into my studies and he was kind of into, ’t, having fun and hanging out and doing stuff which i can appreciate but i was sort of past that i think so anyway um we kind of split off for a while then in the last few years we’ve sort of started hanging out again he, and now he actually has moved down to chicago to go to um columbia art college downtown um so, for a while he stayed with music, i didn’t, but he stayed with music and he got a degree in recording and production technology or something like that so he was uh recording and doing some sound engineering and running sound at different events and stuff but he decided, i think he got a little bored with that, he wanted to get really into drawing and just be creative kind of generally so he decided to go back and actually get a ba because he didn’t do that before he got a an associates degree so now that, so he’s decided to come down here, he just moved down um at the beginning of the month uh he moved into old town into sort of a work live space um where he can work and live i guess and uh draw and do music production.', 'i worry about him a lot because he’s older and this weekend he was having all this trouble with his back and that stresses me out but, at least i have other siblings at home to take care of him or whatever not that he needs to, but my dad would just never complained or ever let you know that he’s having a problem with anything, so it stresses me out a little bit um, because its you have back problems are you still gonna be lifting and doing everything and hoeing the garden or mowing or whatever so um yeah, ever never or would ever um, which i respect and i i just think i am like him a lot and i look up to him a lot and i, it’s i hate all these phrases like what role model, and just knowing you know someone that’s done really things didn’t necessarily i think work out for him in the way he wanted he wanted to go to law school but he was drafted and then he worked instead of going to vietnam, or he taught the whole, but um, he’s just he would never complain about anything and i think that’s just a really big thing that i learned from him.', 'um, she’s a photographer um, she graduated last year um, i’m still in school but so she’s um, she still works around the city, um still works the same job um, her sister just moved in with us um, in the summer

when we do, i know that it it’ll be okay, later um, i’m trying to think um, she just um, yeah we just have very different values but we’re still able to come around to the same ideas and we still like each other a lot despite the fact that we’ve had different experiences and think different things about a lot of stuff was hard for a while when she wasn’t totally getting where i was coming from about some things but i think we’ve come around and we get each other better now and we just um yeah, i think so, yeah because it was hard because we’re coming from a very different place for for a while um, but she’s just we both changed a lot since high school so it’s interesting to see um, how that’s happened um, and its very important to me that she, not approves but thinks well of the people i date that was a problem for a while.', 'he’s a real social butterfly, he’s he uh has several different circles of friends and um because of him i’ve made a lot more friends, i’ve uh expanded my circle of friends so, he’s definitely the kind of person who’s always out there and talking to people, meeting new people, and get just gets along with everybody he’s also really emotional though, he’s a really um, he’s kind of the opposite of me, i don’t have, i don’t outwardly display a lot of emotions so maybe we we balance each other really well but he always eager to tell me about how he’s feeling and um helping helping to deal with whatever’s going on.', 'but um, i just look out for him because i know that he he i he definitely wants to fight certain battles with my parents, that i didn’t want to with yeah, exactly and more protective and they know that he, ’t but i also i think it’s nice having him at home because i know he looks out for my parents in a way that i can’t really

he has two two incredible kids and um he still manages to work out all the time, he’s a he’s some kind of a super hero i think because he and he looks like it too, he’s like twenty eight inch waist and big arms and looks kind of cartoonish but in a in a good way um i don’t know how he does it all; i don’t know how he balances everything and he actually recently moved to florida to take a new job and that really sucks because he’s not physically around um although i we don’t we haven’t worked together for a few years but um it was nice to know that he was in in the area that we could hang out sometimes but now it’ll be a little more of a challenge um so i’m kinda sad that he moved away, um but it’s a good, really good opportunity for him um although i can’t, i don’t know why he moved to florida um let’s see uh um he’s uh he’s an incredible family person and he has he has two kids, he has a son and daughter and he’s he’s so busy with work and so busy with the other stuff, he always um makes time for them and that was reflected in how he managed people too and make sure that he uh, the people that worked for him had a good work life balance if he needed to do something, go to his son or daughter’s uh play, or pick them up from somewhere, or take them on a family vacation, he was very uh very understanding of that and um you could tell whenever i would interact with him and i knew his wife too and uh they were real very similar, they were really family oriented but really focused on work too uh yeah, and then overall just a really easy person to get along with and um you never felt like you were being bossed around or supervised by him it was always more of a um partnership and a mentorship, it really felt like he was a leader there’s a bit of difference in a leader and a supervisor i think um he’s he’s someone the to look up to.', \"um i guess we have been pretty seriously dating since we met um we had a really good connection right off and it's been um a bit stressful with him being in graduate school he's very, very busy, and now with him being gone, but um but i think overall, we have a really strong, healthy relationship we talk uh every day since he's been gone and i'm really looking forward to his year being over with so that we can live in the same city again, and see each other uh on a daily basis i think that makes relationships a lot um a lot

and people starting giving me nicknames because in our lab, nicknames are kind of the things that you do so, um since my name’s hannah, people call me hannah banana or hannah montana um and for a while he was walking by my bench everyday and he would look at me and say, hello, hannah montana i didn’t know what to make of this at first because i didn’t know him for very long and so, i just thought he was a strange guy and i wasn’t sure if he was flirting with me or, or what but it turns out he's just just a strange guy um so, let's see what else about bill um oh yes, i, so i i needed his help, actually this weekend for a project in the lab and my boss called him up to ask him if he’d be around to help me out um and it turns out that he’s going to be in lab, but he’s just always in lab, he’s normally there until eight or nine at night anyways um so, he emailed me to say, well, this is going on, can you arrange a time to meet with me and then at the end he said, when would be a good time for our little rendezvous, he’s very playful like that; he’s engaged to somebody else and it's not anything but he likes to have fun with his word of choices um let's see, um, um, he likes opera and music a lot so we talk about those things in the lab, usually.\", 'um, she’s very sarcastic but very caring and she has really good relationships with people she’s not uh, about acquaintances so i think that helps her even though it makes things harder especially that point in life she’s really good, um better off for it um, she has a good relationship with me and my mom and a terrible one with my dad um, ’t i get to see her in early december, i’m excited and hmm, ’t there’s too much um, we have a lot of inside jokes, i guess uh, that don’t make any sense to anyone else um, ’t it’s really a vague, hard to get into a whole person um hmm, uh, we used to fight all the time i guess brothers more than sisters, but we hated each other and we went through a distance period when i was in college and she was in high school and a later part of when i was in school when i was at school away at school she was um, i guess she kind of matured more and made it easier for us to relate to each other because four years is a big difference, and now we’re really close and it’s it’s easier to talk to her and tell her everything’s gonna be okay without her being like, god you don’t know what you’re talking about, she’s very, i know but still.', 'so, david um, he was until recently a roommate of mine uh i think we got along pretty well considering um his mission before uh

situation, which is always, ’t, i sort of felt guilty at the same time when uh he would uh use or have things just because i’m not that type of person anyway where i wanna constantly give give back but he would always be giving, giving, and i’m just like, he’d eventually return the favor one day um so at i’m, i’m at the moment i’m using a computer biz until recently, i had a a, a flood at my

to go to school at a branch of indiana university in my parents' hometown um and he's, i think that will be a good experience for him because he doesn't really have the skills to live uh alone or live

on his shoulder it looks ridiculous, but i told him it looks good and um, so that’s yeah, yeah it’s like that i’ve known him for a long time like i said um he works for southwest airlines he lives with his old man in chicago, and uh he helps him out because he had cancer, and he’s got a bunch of problems so, and they’re divorced his parents all my friends’ parents are divorced, it’s really weird, mine aren’t, but um he works at southwest he was never the greatest in school but we hang out a lot though sometimes.', 'yeah and um, he’s from the midwest which i think is a big part of him too he’s definitely got some of the midwest stuff in him but he’s really smart also and he’s incredibly fashionable he has really great taste in clothes and movies and everything even just putting a room together, he’s able to do that and i think that’s really cool because i have really bad taste so it’s really cool living with him because he’s really good about it but um, yeah exactly, he gets really crazy sometimes though he likes to go really crazy when he parties and um, but he also has really severe anxiety sometimes and he gets really upset about things so it gets really weird when he gets upset because he keeps it all inside and then eventually it’ll, it explodes once he was mad at me and i didn’t know about it and he pulled me out of my room in the middle of the night and started screaming at me in the hallways and i said, oh wow but it was, it’s like tough love and it really, its fits him really well and it’s great being his friend here because he’s a really honest opinion of things and he’s really straight forward about it, unless he’s keeping it inside which is unhealthy but it’s the way that he does things so and um, he wants to go into fashion consulting but the business side of it he was an econ major for a while but i think it was too hard for him so he stopped, so but he works really hard and he’s um, he’s in moda, which is one of the clubs and he’s really in charge of it and i think it’s really impressive because it used to be, it was always cool but he made it really cool and interesting and, he actually designed a line for the fall fashion show.', 'um, chris is my boyfriend he’s actually the only person i’ve ever dated, which is weird and um, i’ve known him for four years we went to school together at college and i met him the first day of school and um, we have been friends for four and a half years before we started dating we started dating after we moved three hours apart from each other which really sucked and then um, he moved to chicago so i came here also and now we’re living close to each other the first time in a while, it’s really nice um, he’s a weird person he a lot of, my friendship with him wasn’t um, i never thought i would date him he wasn’t an important you could talk to this person, he was just always fun and yeah, yeah and now when i see pictures of him in school or us in school, he’s two different people, it’s really bizarre because he’s changed a lot and matured a lot and um, he’s very kind, very hard on himself and um, he, right now he’s working for the government he he never thinks that he’s doing enough but he’s the youngest person working where he’s working, it’s really cool um, so he’s in a nine month training program and goes in everyday and sits in a classroom so he’s kinda going a little crazy um, he also just joined a bowling league and his first day was yesterday.', \"it's good.\", 'yeah, it’s very good.', 'it’s good.', 'it’s pretty funny.', \"it's been good.\", 'it’s been good.', 'and um, but he i just i think he looks up to me he went vegan immediately after i went vegetarian which is either an admiration thing or just the one up thing, i’m not really sure and um, but he’s always borrowing my books or hanging out in my room when i’m not there, after i moved away and um, he just i definitely have a special affection for him because we’re so similar and because i think we have so much in common and um, i like him a lot i think he’s really cool, he is turning into a cool person i like watching that and it’s just funny to, what else do i say um, ’t i i’ve always just kinda hung out with him more like he’s my friend than my brother and i like bringing him to things i like introducing him to people and he gets along with a lot of um, my friends and he used to be really, really quiet and shy and very um, keeping to himself but he’s definitely since getting more involved in high school getting a lot more sociable and he’s just got a really cool interesting personality he has a lot of friends now when he didn’t before in junior high and so that xxx yeah, he’s opened up a lot more which is really cool and he’s had it’s just cool to watch him and my sister get so into high school in a way that i never did socially and, extracurricular he’s um, he’s a runner, he’s a really great runner uh, insanely always is second place and whatever race he is in, first or second and um, he’s just very um, ’t i’m not sure what else to say i just like him a lot i’m looking forward to seeing him tomorrow um, i’m always trying to get him to come hang out with me in chicago and see different things and come stay with me when he can because i do look out look out for him in a way that i don’t, my other siblings and he just he is also just very emotional.', 'i worry about him a lot because he’s older and this weekend he was having all this trouble with his back and that stresses me out but, at least i have other siblings at home to take care of him or whatever not that he needs to, but my dad would just never complained or ever let you know that he’s having a problem with anything, so it stresses me out a little bit um, because its you have back problems are you still gonna be lifting and doing everything and hoeing the garden or mowing or whatever so um yeah, ever never or would ever um, which i respect and i i just think i am like him a lot and i look up to him a lot and i, it’s i hate all these phrases like what role model, and just knowing you know someone that’s done really things didn’t necessarily i think work out for him in the way he wanted he wanted to go to law school but he was drafted and then he worked instead of going to vietnam, or he taught the whole, but um, he’s just he would never complain about anything and i think that’s just a really big thing that i learned from him.', 'but um, i just look out for him because i know that he he i he definitely wants to fight certain battles with my parents, that i didn’t want to with yeah, exactly and more protective and they know that he, ’t but i also i think it’s nice having him at home because i know he looks out for my parents in a way that i can’t really my dad and my dad does a lot, and um, i know that he he’s just so busy and it’s just cool i’m not i’m having a hard time being articulate but he’s um, he’s a really good person and he has really good values, i think and he knows what he likes and that’s nice and it just it’s cool seeing him he’s also just really talented but he’s really humble.', 'i think it’s pretty even.', 'yeah yeah he’s just he’s just an amazing person, he has two two incredible kids and um he still manages to work out all the time, he’s a he’s some kind of a super hero i think because he and he looks like it too, he’s like twenty eight inch waist and big arms and looks kind of cartoonish but in a in a good way um i don’t know how he does it all; i don’t know how he balances everything and he actually recently moved to florida to take a new job and that really sucks because he’s not physically around um although i we don’t we haven’t worked together for a few years but um it was nice to know that he was in in the area that we could hang out sometimes but now it’ll be a little more of a challenge um so i’m kinda sad that he moved away, um but it’s a good, really good opportunity for him um although i can’t, i don’t know why he moved to florida um let’s see uh um he’s uh he’s an incredible family person and he has he has two kids, he has a son and daughter and he’s he’s so busy with work and so busy with the other stuff, he always um makes time for them and that was reflected in how he managed people too and make sure that he uh, the people that worked for him had a good work life balance if he needed to do something, go to his son or daughter’s uh play, or pick them up from somewhere, or take them on a family vacation, he was very uh very understanding of that and um you could tell whenever i would interact with him and i knew his wife too and uh they were real very similar, they were really family oriented but really focused on work too uh yeah, and then overall just a really easy person to get along with and um you never felt like you were being bossed around or supervised by him it was always more of a um partnership and a mentorship, it really felt like he was a leader there’s a bit of difference in a leader and a supervisor i think um he’s he’s someone the to look up to.', 'so i think it’s fantastic.', 'it’s pretty cool.', 'it’s so noisy, well this is the city we just go back and forth about why he hates chicago and why i think the suburbs suck so we go back and forth, every time we talk on the phone um, but other than that, other than that he’s, he’s, he’s funny um, he thinks i have lot of attitude and i laugh because he has attitude i just give it right back to him so i’m only really just um, it’s kinda like someone banters with you back and forth and you just can, i’m quick, i can give it right back give it right back and he hates that, he hates that, so i think it’s kinda funny i think he, i think he drinks with his buddies, they’ll go to watch sports and they’ll drink and i don’t drink at all so that’s, that’s kinda awkward for me.', \"it's pretty cool.\", 'he’s a real social butterfly, he’s he uh has several different circles of friends and um because of him i’ve made a lot more friends, i’ve uh expanded my circle of friends so, he’s definitely the kind of person who’s always out there and talking to people, meeting new people, and get just gets along with everybody he’s also really emotional though, he’s a really um, he’s kind of the opposite of me, i don’t have, i don’t outwardly display a lot of emotions so maybe we we balance each other really well but he always eager to tell me about how he’s feeling and um helping helping to deal with whatever’s going on.', 'so, yeah, it’s really good.', \"yeah, it's kind of nice.\", 'and um i i feel like more recently, within the past couple of years, i’ve been able to come with him, come to him with problems and things like that i always felt like it was kind of weird talking about certain things like that, just certain problems and stuff, just because, ’t but i i feel like now, more than ever, it’s like um he’s much more receptive to that kind of thing and um i feel like he’s been, he’s been giving pretty helpful advice he’s been telling me that he’s been, he’s been pumping out good advice on all different kinds of levels.', \"it's really kind of funny.\", 'um, it was really hard for us to separate because we went to the same school together up until the end of high school um so when he went to college, um, when he went to college, i was going through a rough time, actually, and i

see uh um he’s uh he’s an incredible family person and he has he has two kids, he has a son and daughter and he’s he’s so busy with work and so busy with the other stuff, he always um makes time for them and that was reflected in how he managed people too and make sure that he uh, the people that worked for him had a good work life balance if he needed to do something, go to his son or daughter’s uh play, or pick them up from somewhere, or take them on a family vacation, he was very uh very understanding of that and um you could tell whenever i would interact with him and i knew his wife too and uh they were real very similar, they were really family oriented but really focused on work too uh yeah, and then overall just a really easy person to get along with and um you never felt like you were being bossed around or supervised by him it was always more of a um partnership and a mentorship, it really felt like he was a leader there’s a bit of difference in a leader and a supervisor i think um he’s he’s someone the to look up to.', 'and um i i feel like more recently, within the past couple of years, i’ve been able to come with him, come to him with problems and things like that i
